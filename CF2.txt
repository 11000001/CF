----------------


Technological Personal Toolkits
These are non-magical items used by a single person, be it a tool up to a single craft bench.


-Companion Bracelet (World Seed) (0CP)
A bracelet housing an evolving AI; although Alliance policy is to hand them out to people only after they’ve gotten their class at level 10, an exception was made for you to get it a bit earlier. Although called a bracelet, there are different forms for different races. Slime people might be injected with a nanite swarm programmed with the same effect, for example. Once you have equipped the bracelet, the AI will adapt itself to gain an ideal personality fitting your own. The AI of a loner might become their perfect friend, that of a rich girl always left alone might become a butler caring for her, and someone living a loveless life might find that their companion AI has all the qualities they’d want in their girlfriend.No matter how your companion AI will end up, they will always end up in your best interest. As they have a photographic memory and see the world through your senses, they can highlight important objects or places you might have missed, jog your memory if you forget something important, or browse through the internet to find information a million times faster than somebody with a human brain would.There are also various upgrades that can add to the functionality of the companion bracelet, such as identifying software allowing your companion AI to scan the Aura of creatures or objects to determine their ability, level, and other information, or even an upgrade to allow an instance of them to live in your brain and tap into your senses to control your body in dangerous situations, or just show the trajectories enemy projectiles will take so you can easily dodge them. For 50 CP each, you can apply one upgrade to your companion bracelet, with no limit on how many you can purchase.


-Micromanipulators (Raildex Science) (50CP) 
These delicate gloves were meant for scientific purposes. They're reinforced with small motors and electrically contracting artificial muscles to allow you to perform delicate work on the scale of a micron. While they're definitely more suited to scientific experiments, they can be put to use in any situation that requires steady hands like aiming a rifle, conducting brain surgery, cooking, defusing a bomb, or even bypassing some redirection and shielding abilities. 
* Micron scale control 


-Diagnostic Tools (Outlaw Star) (50CP)
A small data display with numerous connectors and scanners, capable of letting you know what is wrong with simple technology and what advanced technology that has been programmed into it.
* Portable, can detect what's wrong with simple tech and do the same for advanced tech that you program into it.
* Keep in mind ‘simple’ is a lot lot higher than modern tech for this scanner, it's from a space fiction. 


-Tool Chest (Satisfactory-factorio Gauntlet) (50CP)
You receive a variant of the normal personal chest. This has more slots to fit more varieties of items, but only a few slots are full-sized. It’s ideal for storing a variety of tools, or the small amounts of various gubbins you find around drop pods. In addition, you receive a blueprint to make copies. All copies of the Tool Chest share inventory - while the copies will not give additional space, that inventory can be accessed from anywhere. As long as at least one copy of the Tool Chest is placed in the world, any items stored in it will continue to exist


-Habitat Constructor (Subnautica) (50CP)
As long as the materials are present in your subspace inventory, the Habitat Constructor is capable of creating robust outposts and domiciles. Due to complex structural requirements, the constructor is unable to build anything that isn’t anchored to the ground. 
* "Complex structural requirements" implies that with sufficient technical abilities this limitation can be overcome.


-Holotable (MCU) (50CP)
A device in the shape of a table used to create holographic models that allow the study, analysis and reconstruction of a vast array of items, weapons and events. Comes in any color of holograms you like and each hologram is capable of being interacted with. Naturally this performs better with additional data.






-Scanner | Upgraded scanner | PDA (Subnautica) (100CP)
Scanner (50CP): The scanner uses the PDA artificial intelligence to analyze an object, often finding weaknesses or uses not immediately apparent to the user. If one of your fabricators is capable of constructing the scanned object, a blueprint is created. Scanning time varies with size and complexity. 
Upgraded scanner (50CP): For those who don’t want to get too close to the Reaper Leviathan, but just really want that scan, this upgrade quadruples the scanning distance and speed.
PDA (0CP): Loaded with an emergency intelligence and more data capacity than you could ever used, this is a survivor’s second most powerful tool (after his or her brain.) The AI may get a bit . . . quirky . . . over long deployments. Your version is basically indestructible. Contains basic construction blueprints.


-The Sewing Machine(Incredibles) (100CP)
Now you might be wondering why I’m offering a single sewing machine... That’s because this technological masterpiece is the very platonic ideal of a sewing machine. This is the one machine fit to work on designs worn by GODS. Working with this will enhance all your sewing skills to greater heights.


-Tool box (Generic Factory) (100CP)
This Tool Box can store any number of hand held tools, and will never get too heavy to carry. Always contains a set of basic tools that can be called on without notice and in any number like hammers, saws and blowtorches. Specialized tools you will have to place inside this box ahead of time.


-The Right Tools For The Job (Freefall) (100CP)
Every job requires tools, be they a socket wrench, measuring tape, a hand saw, or mop. So long as it is either mundanely accessible without background checks or you already have it, you can summon a copy of any tool you need. This only applies to when you're cleaning, fixing, building, or other material-based preparation. You can't directly use it in combat and you can't use the material of the tool itself.
* In case it is not clear, free summon of any tool you own to your hand at will.


-The Toolkit (Sabaton) (100CP) 
When wielding this toolkit, you can repair devices most would think broken beyond salvation. You could find two twisted armor plates and a couple of treads and before you know it, you have a tank that's as good as new.
* Extremely op portable repair kit
* Arguably reality warping or influences the wielder as text gives no mention of the users own skills


-Jewelry Set (Timespinner) (100CP)​ 
A set of tools for crafting jewelry or rings, as well as a small amount of material for making them, such as gold, silver, or gemstones. The provided material will replenish once a month if used.


-Chemical Synthesizer (Hive Queen Quest) (100CP)
 This microwave sized machine is truly a wonder of modern science, able to synthesize any non-magical chemical known to man in up to 12 oz batches. Synthesizing a chemical takes roughly an hour and works via a small Tablet interface.
* A bit underpriced for any matter creator, even with the small volume and time needed, born from lacking knowledge that ever matter falls under chemical.


-Satsfactorio Builder|Craft Bench Card|Pattern Extension Chip(Satisfactory-factorio Gauntlet) (100CP)
Satsfactorio Builder (0CP) : The buildy gun from Satisfactory. It can place down buildings and other artificial structures, either from parts or premade. It can deconstruct buildings and other artificial objects, either breaking them down or storing them whole. It can give orders to logistic or construction systems that you are authorized on (including the ones from this Gauntlet.) It can configure the settings of machines. It has an internal inventory that can be upgraded (to a limited extent until you leave the Gauntlet).  Always fully charged, can be upgraded in other ways, automatically imports into similar handheld stuff, and syncs up with other inventory/storage Perks, Items, and items. If lost, stolen, or broken, it will respawn in an appropriate and safe place immediately, even during the Gauntlet.
Craft Bench Card (50CP) : This card, when installed in the Satisfactorio Builder, lets it craft any recipe that you can craft at any crafting station internally, though slower than you could at a dedicated station.
Pattern Extension Chip (50CP) : This card, when installed in the Builder, grants it the ability to create ad-hoc blueprints based on existing machines, and then fill those blueprints in. You can use it to quickly and easily extend groups of belts, or lines of machines. It will faithfully execute patterns that change as they iterate. It also allows doing multiple patterns, such as two production lines for different products and the foundations at once, even if those patterns don’t line up or have different lengths.


-Exo-Womb (free fall) (100CP) 
The first generation of Bowman’s Wolves were gestated in dogs with genetically modified red wolf DNA. Now you can have your future generations be developed in a more controlled environment. Simply insert one or more viable biological samples that are no smaller than a single drop of blood into the receptacle and this will provide a perfect and indestructible environment for the child. If you are one of the donors, any perks relating to children and inheritance may apply. It takes the typical amount of time and only works with organisms of the same species unless you have perks to alter that.




-Box Of Hammers (Lego dimensions) (100CP)
You can buy this box of hammers instead. This box comes with a dozen or so hammers, each of which grants the one holding it a copy of the Builder Power
* Builder: You can build a mountain, if you do it brick by brick. Given all of the relevant pieces, and some sort of instructions on what to make, you can build almost any object quickly and efficiently by slotting the various pieces together. IKEA instructions are no match for your building might.


-Cranial implants (Adeptus Mechanicus) (100CP)
The brain of every magos undergoes extensive modification over time, but you have put great care into preparing your mind for the Machine God's mysteries. Beyond the gene-alterations and bionic sub-systems that have boosted your intelligence, regulated neuro-chemistry reduces the influence that hunger, pain, fear and other flesh-distractions can have upon your thoughts. Your ability to enjoy these things are not impeded. Further neurological modifications will be faster and easier to adapt to with less worry of rejection.


-Monkey Wrench (Megas XLR) (200CP)
Normally takes the form of a Monkey Wrench. If you could expect to find it in a chop shop, than, with a firm shake and a thought, the Monkey Wrench will perfectly imitate any handheld tool.




-PSYCHOSCOPE (PREY) (200CP)
The Psychoscope is an advanced scanning tool developed by Morgan Yu to gather information about the Typhon. It is able to provide an experienced user specialised information about the aliens which can be used to develop new Neuromods. The device was built around the Typhon, though can be used on humans and robots. It will require an updated if you want to use it to scan new biologist, which can be built with the right skills. A Psychoscope can support 8 chipsets at a time, not including its core scanning hardware and has a stock range of about 10 meters.




-TRANSTAR SUIT - ARTX EVA SUITE UPGRADE (PREY) (200CP)
The TranStar suit is a multipurpose uniform that is designed to quickly and easily interface with an EVA system and utilise touch screens through the gloves. Volunteers are given a green suit and will not be trusted by the rest of the staff. Security is given a while and black suit, science a blue and black suit, Engineering an orange and black suit, and executive staff a red and black suit. Even in its basic state the suit gives a small amount of protection against environmental hazards and physical attacks along with a flashlight. The suit can take up to 8 additional chipsets, expanding it's capabilities.


-Omnitool | Scanner (Mass effect Andromeda) (200CP)
Omnitool (100CP) : You get an omni-tool loaded up with programs and information that’d be best suited for unsupported colonization in a new galaxy. Because the Andromeda Initiative knew that they’d be going with a finite supply of ammo, medi-gel and power cells, each omni-tool can recover and repurpose appropriate resources to serve appropriate functions. For example, liquid coolant allows weapon heatsinks to be reused, and organic compounds can be refined into medi-gel. They can also convert consumable items into immediately usable forms. Finally, they do everything else regular omni-tools can: Communication, manufacturing fabricator, sensor analysis, and computer mainframe.
Scanner (100CP) : This omni-tool mounted system is how theAndromeda Initiative plans to rapidly survey planets. This system is a fast and accurate sampling system that is formally known as Panoptes. When linked to an AI, it can produce multiple analyses and predictive models in seconds, turning what would be the surveying work of weeks into mere moments. For most purposes it uses a transmitted accelerator mass spectrometer to create a “snapshot” of an objects components, atomic weight, and radioactivity, allowing for in-depth analysis. For biological materials, the system switches to an electrospray ionization system, so that plants or animals can be scanned without causing radiation damage. For a Jumper, you no longer need to have an AI linked to the system for it to work, though that would help. You can also take DNA scans of organisms for further study, and scan devices to help you figure out what they do, and maybe later reproduce them. Lastly, if you have a longer ranged sensor system, you could link the Scanner to that to scan further away, even if being in the Scanner’s original range would get you clearer results.


-Architect Gizmo Pack (Terraria - Journey's End) (200CP)
A backpack full of tools that can greatly increase construction speed, and also allows the user to place and interact with objects from a fairly significant distance.
* Interacting at a distance could come in hand with materials which are dangerous on a level beyond heat or radioactivity such as the black crystals from Skulduggery Pleasant
* Interacting at a distance is also extremely good for combat. 
* Depending as to whether that counts as interactive with objects yes it is possible.


-Faber Set (Draka Series) (200CP)
This is a small device, about the size of your usual attache case, with flanged pans down the sides. Part of the standard gear of the Samothracian cyber-commandos of the interstellar era, this is a full set of Nano-Fabricators, ready for you to use. Put stuff in the left pan, and the faber breaks it down on the molecular level and reassembles it in the right pan. You can build anything that you have schematics for or have reverse-engineered a sample of, provided that you have sufficient raw elements to form the necessary compounds and it’s something that actually can be reproduced by a non-magical molecular assembly device. This is a smaller model, so if you want to use it to build a large machine with this you’ll need to build parts and assemble them manually. You do, however, also get a full-size Industrial Fabricator installed in your warehouse, ready for whatever purposes you might care to use it for.


-Monkey tool | Diagnostic upgrade | Fabrication upgrade (Bloons) (200CP)
Monkey Tool (100CP) - A powerful multi tool, with unfoldable attachments to manipulate any screw or sprocket. Has a hefty hammer head on one end as well.
Diagnostic Upgrade (50CP) - New attachments allow you to scan items, learning what they are made of, how damaged they are, and other information.
Fabrication Upgrade (50CP) - New attachments are designed for shaping materials into new shapes, bending, cutting, welding, and more.


-Modular Nanofabricator (Orion’s Arm The Amalgamation) (200CP)
This coffee table sized transapientech fabricator can manufacture many things, but at current it’s limited up to S1 and a select few S2 technologies and materials. It’s open for modifications and upgrades, though, and can process exotic and esoteric materials if you have them.


-Utility Mods (Dead Space) (200CP) 
Ah, technology, the best part of the future. The Kinesis Module projects an artificial gravity field from an emitter pad on the palm of the hand it's mounted on. Much like the name might imply, this field allows you to lift objects; smaller objects hover about a foot in front of your palm, whereas larger objects, most of which must be specifically modified to work with it and are typically on tracks or rails, move as close to you as they are able. You can manipulate these objects with your hand, and even throw them with a surprising amount of force, enough to penetrate a body with a bone spike and nail it to a steel wall. Stasis, on the other hand, as its name might imply, creates a temporal stasis field of a certain volume around the targeted object. It affects both organic and inorganic material, including living creatures, and has no problem with irregularly-shaped objects, flowing out around the targeted object.
* Allows for the movement of objects remotely as well as freeze them in place while working on them.


-Warehouse roboport (Factorio) (200CP) 
A tablet that always returns to you after being lost or destroyed controls a small fleet of robots that fly out of a hatch in the cosmic warehouse's ceiling. These drones can move small items and will work together to carry up to a ton at a time, and have tools that allow for simple constructions to be performed, if you provide the system with digital blueprints. The drones can range a kilometer from the door to the cosmic warehouse, but can link up with constructed roboports to extend their range. The robots vanish if the warehouse door closes. The robots can draw from both normal and warehouse versions of the provider chests. You start with a single normal version of the provider chest, with plans to make more. You will have to source the tools and materials to do such from elsewhere. 


-Scanner (Iji) (200CP) 
Serves a number of purposes. Primarily, allows you to determine the location of all living creatures within a large radius around the user, although this might be blocked by certain defenses or stealth abilities. Also capable of determining molecular structure and provides blueprints when scanning objects.
* Can detect living things at large range and get molecular structure and blueprints for objects. Is portable.


-One-Stop Crafting Station (Starbound) (200CP)
A single large workbench that can reconfigure its surface and toolset to handle all of your crafting needs. As long as you provide the ingredients and recipes / blueprints, you can use this crafting station to construct anything you want. Note that while you could use this to help you build all the pieces of a starship or skyscraper, you’d still have to put all those pieces together yourself.


-Hands Of A Fran (Franken Fran) (200CP)
6 attachable arms that link up to your nervous system, they greatly enhance speed and multitasking, with no drop in precision or control. Become a one-man surgery team. Free bulky labcoat to conceal the arms.
* Assuming each pair symbolizes an extra mental thread, when utilized with powers from under Time, it gets rather crazy, effectively multiplying your building speed by 4.


-AR Masking Software | ‘The Eye’ AR Windows (Eclipse Phase) (200CP) 
AR Masking Software (100CP) Augmented Reality software overlays your vision with realistic (or not-so-realistic) graphics, effectively changing or adding to what you see. This is normally used as a navigational aid (eg: painting a path in your vision to show the route to something) or for gaming, but you could also use it for many other purposes - for example you could give your muse a "body" that seems to move around the environment or fill an empty room with a simulated crowd, but of course it wouldn't be able to interact with anything. It can also edit out things you don't want to see (leaves a red outline in place for safety reasons), or place censoring over things. This version has zero lag and no advertisements, and is shared to any companions who have mesh inserts. 
‘The Eye’ AR Windows (100CP) These AR display windows match things in your field of vision to data from Firewall's databases, wikis, chat channels and forum posts - so if you happen to walk past a known trafficker of TITAN artifacts on the streets of Noctis, an AR window will flag them and display what The Eye knows about them. Unfortunately, The Eye is only good for things that Firewall knows about - new threats won't raise flags or have any data. In future worlds, The Eye AR windows tend to flag things in the databases or general awareness of groups with similar objectives to Firewall, but are fairly light on hard data - mostly something like "This individual is wanted for questioning by SHIELD and is considered armed and dangerous" or "This carving is a sign used by Thayan spies to mark meeting spots". You can dismiss the AR windows or keep them from appearing at any time.
* Masking software can serve as a memetic filter with decent programming. 
* Windows can provide access to the information of any secretive organisation.


-Cradle (MCU) (200CP)
Weapons of war are not the only thing to advance, and this medical bed is proof of that. This human-sized medical device can heal wounds by scanning the wounded area and then re-growing skin tissue to a degree of accuracy that visually one wouldn't be able to tell there was a wound. If improved, there might be a way to let it 'grow' an entire body, but it would take a great degree of medical knowledge to sufficiently do so. There is then the issue of giving it a consciousness; it can create bodies but it cannot create life.


-Extraction kit|Extraction kit upgrade (Inception) (200CP)
Extraction Kit (0CP) This machine lies at the very heart of the story, and is used to allow up to ten participants to share a dream together. It’s small enough to fit into a briefcase, robust enough to operate even in harsh environments such as sub-zero temperatures or following its use as a blunt weapon,and remarkably simple to operate. Each participant is connected to the device using an IV-like injector.
Extraction Kit Upgrade (200CP) The Extraction Kit is an ingenious little device, but it does have its limits. This upgrade allows all your Extraction Kits to automatically function in future settings, updating schematics and formulas as necessary to interface with anything sentient. Elves, aliens, potentially even A.I. and ghosts will all be readily compatible with a bit of tweaking. In addition, this variant of the Extraction Kit is easily modified, allowing you to readily improve it further by, for example, connecting it to computer databases, eliminating the need for sedatives or combining it with other methods of mental interaction such as magic or telepathic broadcasts.


-Modular armor (Factorio) (300CP)
An armored and environmentally sealed suit, designed to keep the wearer alive in a wide variety of alien environments. On-board recycling systems handle waste, keep the internals clean, and produce clean water along with a nutritious if tasteless paste to feed the wearer. Occasional top-offs with fresh water and biomass will be required. But the main draw of this armor is the extremely robust power system and programming suite that can quickly install and adapt to new attachments, integrating them into existing systems and adjusting them to best suit the wearer. Comes with a portable fusion reactor, battery array, strength- and speed-boosting exoskeleton, and night vision attachments pre-installed. You may import another suit of armor you own to gain these qualities.
* Might be more suited for safety, but it’s at least tangentially related to crafting


-Advanced Materials Upgrade Kit (Light of Terra DLC 4 - Lords of the Iron Line) (300CP)
Plasteel, adamantium, armourplas, synth-leather and other sophisticated materials are used for all sorts of purposes within the Imperium, and are typically far more resilient than their archaic equivalents. Archaic styles of armour are seldom effective against advanced weapons, and rarely used in any case, but many of those who hail from primitive cultures favour the styles of wargear they are accustomed to. Wrought from plasteel and armourplas instead of bronze, iron and steel, a suit of chain or plate can be a quite effective defence, often the equal of more modern armours. Includes Lathe armour plating which is strong and light, flexible enough to withstand the most powerful blows, and even resistant to intense heat or the crackling edge of a power weapon.
* Toolkit designed to upgrade any armor to Extreme Scifi materials


-STC Converter (Warhammer 40k: Adeptus Mechanicus) (300CP)
This tome-sized cogitator is designed to be fed blueprints for alien or out-of-jump technology and convert them to use STC-standard parts and design principles, well-known for being extremely robust. Perfect translation and equal functionality is not guaranteed, while technology that relies on unique materials or scientific principles not native to the 40k setting will most likely be impossible to recreate. The blueprints that result from successful conversions can be followed by any competent tech-priest. Running blueprints for Magitech or psionic technology through this device without a supreme understanding of 40k metaphysics is an exceedingly bad idea.


-Digital Storage System (Infinite Stratos) (300CP)
A small remote control that links to a storage of digitised matter, this allows one to store and instantly summon with a click of a button a great array of materials or objects. The remote is able to store up to several IS frames at a time at maximum, though there is no particular limit on it only storing IS frames. If you want to pack it full of missiles or bombs, it could make a deadly surprise weapon.


-Neural Plugs | VR Construct Hub (The Matrix) (300CP)
Neural Plugs (100CP): Humans are no longer born outside of Zion. They are grown, and the plugs upon your body are a mark of shame... as well as a mark of pride, for turning the tools of the Machines against them. A plug on the base of your skull, along with plugs in various places on your body, will allow you to inject things into yourself and connect plugs much more efficiently than stabbing yourself, as well as giving you an 'in' to the Matrix. For an additional 50CP, you can also be given a 'neural rig' chair set-up, allowing one to connect to the Matrix and its related functions without a plug. Interesting how wireless can offer so many options. 
VR Construct Hub (200CP): Sometimes all you need is just a way to get things in order... or visualize it, if need be. This machine system is a virtual workspace or "loading program" created to run simulations or upload virtual objects inside a computer-generated reality, allowing you to essentially world-build or train someone. Of course there's a limit to what you can do, with processing power and the energy required to maintain it... but I'm sure if you hooked it up to the right machines, you could say, have people controlling a city's defense grid inside a white room. Or generate places to hone one's skills. ...just don't do anything too bad with this? Please? 


-Promethean Hacking Apps (Eclipse Phase)  (400CP)
A collection of dizzyingly advanced software tools that can turn an average Joe or an AI into a reasonable hacker, and give an excellent hacker the chance to beat a TITAN at their own game – assuming a level playing field, of course. Not even this software will out-hack a TITAN if your hardware, connection and mental speed are lacking.
* TITANS are unchained exponentially upgrading AIs
* A ‘reasonable hacker’ is in terms of the far flung future when network security AIs are a thing and people are extremely paranoid about network security because quite a lot of people live digitally.


Cracked Desktop CM (Eclipse Phase) (400CP)
A desktop cornucopia machine, about the size of a large photocopier, with all safety and copyright limiters removed. It can make almost anything you have the blueprints and correct feedstock for. It can't make antimatter or anything that requires nanotech more advanced than this setting has. If you are trying to make something bigger than the CM itself, you may need it to print smaller parts you then assemble.
* The best nanotech of the setting can go up to femtotech and picotech 


-Lighter (Hive Queen Quest) (400CP)
 Given to the Red Queen by the Great Lee owning this lighter greatly enhances the rate at which you research foreign technology, can also start fires. Includes a small chain to hang it around your neck. Fits all sizes.


-C Cube (Artemis Fowl) (400CP)
Ah. Yes, this. This is a curious little thing, especially since it’s not supposed to exist yet when you enter the jump. But you have it anyway. This is a small cube, of a colour of your choice, with a pop-out keyboard and screen that open on command. This is, well, the be all and end all of computer technology, in one little package.
It can interface with any electronic or digital data storage or communication medium, any phone or computer, simply by being in their proximity, or in the proximity of any device connected to them via a network. It can even interface with radio waves and similar transmissions, or ‘surveillance beams’.
It has unlimited storage and obscene processing power, being able to access, hack and control any and all computer systems, no matter how advanced, in seconds at the very most. It can break any code, and download any amount of data, all in moments. Any data acquired can be ‘compensated’, bringing spotty videos to 4k quality and shitty audio to the finest surround sound you can imagine, the same applicable for other forms of data.
It can function as a phone, computer and TV, including presenting itself as different devices if it’s had a chance to ‘download’ them. It could tell if you were being observed by a satellite, and the registration number and owners of the sat too.
It’s indestructible, and comes with an inviolable connection to the internet. All of them, in fact. The internet for every world you’ve been to and go to hereafter, listed side by side. Though every connection other than the one to your current world is one-way only, meaning you can read and watch and download all you want, but can’t send anything back.
* Allows for information from previous modern and higher jumps to be accessed.


-Silver Wonder (Digimon World Re: Digitize) (400CP)
A unique tablet capable of functioning just fine wherever you take it; be it in a digital world or a realm between dimensions. Aside from effectively being an entire computer engineering workshop in the palm of your hand, and possessing an unlimited internet connection; this technological marvel is capable of actively manipulating the data in digital worlds in the hands of a sufficiently skilled and knowledgeable user, allowing them to bring their digital dreams to life. Moreover, it has exceptional sensor arrays for its size; allowing it to scan an island sized region for all sorts of energy signatures and disturbances once properly programmed, or even analyze ongoing phenomenon.
* Given that the digital world is essentially another dimension this item essentially allows for indirect reality warping.


-The Seed (Sword Art Online SB) (400CP) 
You’ve come across something quite impressive here Jumper, the culmination of Akihiko Kayaba’s work and something that can revolutionise the world if properly applied. The most basic and obvious use of this is as a development kit — a preset series of program packages and media resources that can be used for creating Virtual Reality worlds, as well as control the input and output of the five senses of players, provided they’re wearing the NerveGear or a device based off it.The second element contained within is the famed Cardinal System, an AI developed to manage the entire system of Sword Art Online, providing balancing to enemy encounters and patching bugs based off what the players encounter and do during play. Why, it can even provide mental care through the Mental Health Counseling Programs it has as part of its sub-system, helping to ensure players are happy and mentally healthy as they play through the game. Cardinal was also famed for creating content whole-cloth without any human input, scouring the internet to craft quests or enemies based off mythology; if you wanted to you could be a one-man game developer for something rivaling a AAA title in content and quality. With study and effort it’s possible to replicate Cardinal and the mental health programs, crafting new AI on the same level as the Mental Health Counseling Program within the Companions section.


-Analytic Tool | Objective Scanner (Generic Space Opera) (600CP)
Analytic Tool (400 CP): With a short scan, this device can reveal nearly anything about an object in question, from general structure and chemical composition, to life signs or medical problems, to general energy readings. You may import any smartphone or tablet device you already own for this option - yes, even the tablet you could gain from the Stellar Charts-item.
Objective Scanner (200 CP): The Analytic Tool greatly improves its resolution allowing for near perfect scans of sub-molecular composition, energy constructs and even more ethereal occurrences.
* Author stated in a comment on the doc that the text as written misrepresents what it was intended to be in response to a comment criticising how it was underpowered in comparison to comparably priced perks in the same doc so it is likely more powerful than the text implies.


-Proto-Tool (Ben 10 0.1) (600CP)
Proto-Tool – Why carry around individual weapons and gadgets all the time? Why not just put all of them into one package? Looks like someone thought about this question long enough to invent this nifty little catch-all tool. The Proto-Tool is a highly advanced device that can change into just about any sort of weapon or bit of gear. Need a scanner? It’s a scanner now. Need an energy bow? It’s an energy bow. Fishing rod? Flashlight? Vacuum? Energy blaster? You name it, the Proto-Tool can change into it. Just about any person-sized device you can imagine, it can change into. The downside is that it has a finite battery life and will need to recharge after extensive amounts of use, and generally won’t make things like a person-sized doomsday weapon without some serious upgrades. You may also add individual weapons or tools to this if you wish, adding more arsenal to your...well, arsenal.
* Power requirements are trivialized by any of the numerous infinite energy items in many jumps.
* Acts as any tool up to a certain size and thus short of fiat essentially invalidates most other tools.
* Unclear if it can be multiple tools at once.

----------------

Technological Facilities
These are non-magical facilities, be them several craft benches to entire buildings.




-Workshop (Personal Reality Supplement v1.3) ​(100CP)
Each purchase of this adds to your Personal Reality, a Workshop needed to perform a specific type of craft, which is to be specified when purchase is made. It comes with a basic set of tools and supplies. Good for fixing or creating all sorts of things, although any complex parts or nonstandard supplies will have to be brought in from outside. Additional purchases can add different types of Workshops to your Personal Reality or expand existing ones. Anything built in one of those workshops is fiat backed to be restored to its original condition within 48 hours if damaged or destroyed
* Grants fiat backing to anything constructed within


-Matter Manipulator (Starbound) (100CP)

* Repairs Machines placed inside, no matter the level.


-Research and Development Center (Mass Effect Andromeda) (100CP)
The R&D center is integral to the Initiative’s colonization efforts in the Heleus cluster. There is one in every settlement. As you increase the amount of information you discover, the more you will be able to progress and discover in the Research section. And Development allows a user to build any object that you have the blueprints/plans for and resources to make it. If you have a ship, you can choose to integrate this into the ship. While the R&D center is initially limited to making things that are man portable, with the appropriate upgrades, that may change. After all, Remnant Vaults have such interesting technology... 
Post Jump, you can choose to have the R&D center be integrated with your Warehouse, have it be placed somewhere mid jump, or even have it be connected to a robot of some sort for mobile crafting purposes.


-Weapons Lab (Starbound)(100CP)
A lab full of analysis and test equipment, aimed specifically at deciphering and improving deadly weaponry. You can use this lab to analyze any weapons that you come across, and given time, can figure out how to isolate and combine the different features of the weapons into other weaponry you create. Comes with a melee and firing range for testing out any weapons as well.
* 100cp because a 1 module ship costs that


-Auto-Factory (Starbound) (100CP)
A room full of various arms and other tools, this factory is designed to be programmed with the blueprints for any item that you know how to create, allowing for raw materials to be fed in from the ship’s storage, and be turned into whatever items are programmed into the factory. Warning: Only items that run on purely mechanical / scientific principles can be made here. If something requires magic or more esoteric energies to be created, it will require your personal touch to actually make, though individual parts could still be crafted by the factory. Can’t make items bigger than the room itself, though it can build the pieces for you to put together yourself later.
* 100cp because a 1 module ship costs that


-Sburb Starter Kit (SBURB) (100CP)

-Specimen Bio-Tank (Resident Evil) (100CP)
Well, your B.O.W. specimens have to come from somewhere don't they? They don't just pop out of the ground like those plebian zombies, and what if you need to make some adjustments? Upon purchasing this, you gain access to a sophisticated bio-tank which is filled with a special fluid. This will not only ensure the B.O.W. is docile and unconscious while immersed, but it also comes with the tools and devices to monitor and make adjustments to the subject inside as needed. Evil laugh not included.

Its tools can be easily customized or replaced with new or different technologies. Moreover, its software includes a kernel that can be used to grow specialized AI and VI systems optimized for various computational substrates and tasks that are always loyal to you.


-A thinker of your own (Hive Queen Quest) (100CP)
This adorable little guy is about 2 feet long and has all the autistic number crunching power of a supercomputer and a truly limitless attention span, if you set him to a research task he will sit and think about it until he finally makes a breakthrough. Whenever they finish a project he will psionically alert you "WE FINISHED RESEARCH FOR QUEEN!" or "WE MADE THING FOR QUEEN!" If you aren't a queen that's ok too, don't worry he still loves you and would do anything in his power to help you, which is a limited proposition since he is literally just a brain with basically useless legs and little to no motor skills.


-Soul of the Forge (World of Warcraft) (200CP)
This spirit that manifests as a small, cyclopean golem made of molten metal and shards, the Soul of the Forge dwells within the workshops and smithies of metalworkers.

-FormOther Brand Medical Pod (Hive Queen Quest) (200CP)
This medical pod is filled with an odd odorless liquid, when a being is placed inside it goes to work stabilizing and then healing them while simultaneously analyzing and storing information about their biology, which makes it incredibly useful for the study of new species. Large enough to fit a large man, fits more if the specimen has no bones Comes in either Technological or Biotech flavors, both function equally well.


-Bat Computer(Injustice) (200CP)
Now this is a must for the enterprising superhero – a supercomputer composed of some of the most bleeding-edge hardware on the planet, capable of hacking into the vast majority of systems worldwide. It can process and transmit information far faster than nearly any other, and it has a number of forensic programs built in. Perhaps most notable is its capacity to analyze and reverse-engineer nearly any substance within the space of a few minutes – and it will eventually prove its ability to do so when it provides the insurgency with the secret to the Regime’s nanotech pills.


-Memory Room (Bladerunner 2049) (200CP)
A special room, attached to your warehouse or another property that you own, that allows for the creation and even manipulation of memories, as well as their insertion into living beings’ minds. The room is about the size of a middling apartment but can otherwise be quite freely manipulated to what you desire by controlling the technology by hand. You’re quite skilled at the use of this room but far from a master for now, which will likely take quite a bit of practice and a very active imagination.


-Lab (Project Arms) (200CP)
This discrete laboratory, hidden away somewhere close to your start point, or elsewhere if you wish, holds a simple automated facility to allow for any mechanical devices brought to be maintained and repaired to their peak functionality. It works best of cybernetics and mechanical prosthetics, and small finicky things like clockwork and computers and not large clunky things like vehicles. It is normally in possession of enough regenerating supplies to keep yourself and your companions properly maintained, plus enough surplus for additional projects here and there.
However should you have purchased Mecha in the Cyborg Section this Lab upgrades to be able to hand repairs and maintenance on the Mecha and comparable small vehicles and robots.
Also should you have purchased Cyber-Immortality also from the Cyborg Section you also have three bays with replacement bodies for yourself contained in the lab. The lab can replace bodies taking out of the lab at the rate of 1 per six months and also contains a supercomputer to house your AI mind when it’s not in a cyborg body with wireless capacity to allow you to move back and forth within a range of 10 kilometres, which can be upgraded with other technology. Installing your mind in a new body takes roughly half an hour and you can choose for difference bodies to have different load-outs and can install your own upgrades with the lab’s auto-engineer/surgeon helping.


-INFINITE FUN SPACE WORLDS (The Culture Minds) (200CP)
A numinous selection of metamathical simulated universes which can be indistinguishable from the real thing. You can live out any fantasies you like in them, from the most realistic slices of life to wildly outrageous war simulations, to varying degrees of controlled narrative or pure mechanistic outcome, and to realistic or magical physics or metaphysics. Or, simply conduct experiments and sims for science and personal enlightenment? These many virtual universes do not consume any of your personal processing ability or memory to maintain.
* Where else can you find infinite simulated universes that you can fully control that can simulate magic and normal physics perfectly.  
* Might not be easy to use for anyone without massive computational skill, this thing is meant to be used by Minds on ships which are basically very very powerful AIs.


-Workshop (Smash Up) (200CP)
 A well-appointed workshop, overflowing with brass, vacuum tubes, and specialized tools. Inspiration comes more easily within these walls.


-Robo Bunker (Dragon Ball GT) (200CP)
What kind of man of science would you be without your very own lab? Hidden underground in your starting world, this high tech laboratory has everything you need to get started on your robotic weapons of mass destruction. While the facility can function as a normal lab, as well as having basic living quarters and strong security measures, it works best towards designing and manufacturing androids or robots on the individual scale, increasing the quality of these personalised products significantly and cutting the time and resources required to make them to just below half the usual amount.


-Portable Workshop (Luck of the Draw) (200CP)
You have a top of the line workshop in a pocket dimension that you can access via a free standing arch. You can set the rate of time compression when you purchase the item up to thirty times faster.


-Crafting Stations (Fallout 4) (300CP)
You have each of the main crafting stations (capable of making armor, weapons, and chems) in your Warehouse; each one greatly simplifies the process of crafting or modifying items. In addition, each one also seems to have the “filler” items that you’d need; the various chemicals and parts that aren’t a significant or expensive part of whatever you’re crafting. They can’t provide anything supernatural or rare, but small amounts of metal for a new gun mod or some dye is fine.




-Simulation Room  (World Seed) (300CP)
One important device any spaceship captain should have in their arsenal, or any militaristic leader at all, for that matter, is a simulation room. With them, it is possible to train against enemy forces all day long in a nigh-infinite amount of configurations and situations, an invaluable preparation for whenever the real thing happens, at least as long as you have accumulated enough data of what it is you need to fight and analyzed their strengths and weaknesses. But it is exactly this problem that the simulation room you have in your possession has solved. As long as you have experienced something personally, you simply need to link your mind with the simulation device, and it will quickly and accurately extrapolate from that information and manage to create a simulation of it that is at least 99.9% accurate, even if you only looked at an enemy fleet and never actually saw its combat capabilities, only growing more accurate as you gain more information. Any amount of people can use this room, its dimensions expanding and contracting as needed and new spots popping up in the same way, and this extrapolation can be used on anyone connecting their mind to it. By default, this is a warehouse attachment, but you can place it wherever you want in the real world.


-Advanced Laboratory (Green Lantern) (300CP)
One of the most advanced on Earth, at that. This is a state-of-the-art lab and workshop, filled with the finest equipment money can buy, uniquely set up to allow you to work on just about any branch of science you wish to. Be it building a car or examining an alien body, you won’t find facilities better than the ones here, that’s for sure.


-Holocron Crafting Station (Star Wars The Old Republic) (300CP)
This crafting station allows you to impart any skill (or set of skills) you have into a holocron, which others may use to learn the skill(s). Requires 8 hours of meditation for each year's worth of training imparted. When used, the holocron increases the user's skills as though you were training them yourself. Both the creation process and the user's education include the effects of all teaching perks you possessed at the time of the holocron's creation when measuring the rate at which they occur. You may place any restriction you can name on who can access your holocrons, and those restrictions will be enforced by Jump Fiat. You may 'update' an already-created holocron to use your new current set of training perks, or modify the restrictions you've placed on it, by bringing it back to the crafting station and meditating with it for 1 hour, modified by teaching perks. Your holocrons may include any subject that can reasonably be described as being 'taught', even if it is not necessarily a 'skill' per se, such as philosophy. You may combine any number of lessons into the same holocron, and choose the exact manner (order, relative emphasis, and so forth) in which they are taught.
* Literally crafts Holocrons


-Simulated Biome (E.V.O. Search for Eden) (300CP)
Added onto your warehouse is a door, which will take you to a large dome chamber. Just be thinking about it you can make this chamber simulate any environment, biosphere, and/or life form beyond its indestructible glass walls and use the controls to tweak the conditions and examine what happens. The space beyond the walls is effectively impossible to interact with in any way aside from the functions of this attachment. The options you have for this simulation will expand as your knowledge and technology does, letting you apply the best of both your mind and potential gear towards seeing just what happens when you mess with the natural order. You might occasionally think you hear a voice berating you for your folly in playing god, but I can assure you that it's all in your head.


-Project Destroyer of Worlds (MCU) (300CP)
What if a person could be made better? If they could possess the density of lead with the volatility of cesium? Think of the power one could have if infused with the properties of materials. Enter this particle infusion chamber. When a person goes in, programming in specifics of how a person should be effected when inserting one or more materials for the infusion process will see them come out with potentially new properties or powers based on the material. Whether they look like they have pieces replaced by these materials or simply possess the properties is up to you, but now there is an answer to Captain America. Become the Destroyer of Worlds.


-Diagnostic Manuals  (Generic Factory) (400CP)
You will get a manual for the upkeep and repair of every object you own. Each manual will be detailed enough to diagnose anything that could go wrong in normal use and perform repairs. Manuals for items you buy with CP can never be permanently lost, but you will only ever get one manual for any object you acquire normally- you may want to use a photocopier on those.
* Useful when using items in crafting sources outside of the CF.


-Sewing and Showcasing Room(Incredibles) (400CP)
A large room perfect for any sewing or otherwise creating of Super Suits and other clothing. It come with hightech sewing equipment, an enormous supply of different mannequins, and a gallery for when you want to show off your best designs. Movable seating and extremely durable glass panes included. May be attached to the Warehouse or any of your properties after the jump.


-Factory 436-1337(Smash Up) (400CP)
 Robots building robots? How perverse. This repurposed Boeing plant can operate at all hours of the night and day, churning out robots of any size, function or design you may wish. Automatically updates with local technology in new settings.


-Hammer And Forge (Legend of Zelda Breath Of The Wild) (400CP)
A personal smithy that you can deploy anywhere, the equipment and fires here are in the best possible condition for truly creating great works of blacksmithing art. Any materials needed to be expended in making these weapons and armor will be replenished, unless they’re explicitly supernatural. As a bonus, you’ll find that as long as you hang up your shingle, it’ll be much easier to find warriors who can make the most of the equipment you craft!


-Personal Laboratory (Pokemon Sword and Shield) (400CP)
Sure, you could get a lot done out of your apartment and publish your findings from notes jotted down in the field, but you’re trying to do this for real, right? It’s time to be professional about this and get your own lab. What a wonderful lab this is too, part fully finished laboratory, and part home; you’ll never have to leave! You can live here, studying a wide variety of subjects using the numerous Pokémon-centric research materials lining the book cases. The Personal Laboratory also comes with additional facilities for any live in assistants you might pick up, with one assistant coming with the purchase and helping with your research. The computers that come with this property are also pretty strong in case you need to run any intense programs.
You have a genetic research lab, why should we keep this one over all the others? We will want a few, but only those that add something that can’t just be covered by knowledge of the setting and building whatever makes this special


-Lab/Workshop (Family Matters) (400CP)
You have access to an excellent workshop, laboratory, office, art studio, or whatever other facility is required for your creations. After this Jump, these will be connected to your Warehouse. Tools and basic materials are supplied, but special or extremely valuable resources must be acquired for yourself.


-Launderer System (No More Heroes) (400CP)
You gain a new thing to place in your warehouse, and though you don’t exactly know how it works the instruction booklet says it can construct beam katanas of all different styles and usefulness if given the right components or if you don’t have those, shoving the right raw ingredients in enough quantity to just manufacture the damn things. With enough technical knowledge, you will be able to discard the manual
* A Beam Katana is basically a Lightsaber from Star Wars


-The Recycling Towers (Nier: Automata) (400CP)
The Recycling Towers are a set of ten large, floating metal structures. Each one is quite massive, containing many floors and enough room for tens of large robot soldiers to be in. while they would certainly do well as heavily armoured, flying troop transports, their real use is in the gathering and reconstruction of matter. Each Tower can suck up physical objects or material from beneath it, gathering them and then reconstructing the matter to a more preferable form inside the Tower. The towers creation abilities are not absolute but it is still able to create almost any of the machine life forms in this world, which can be quite complicated, and it may be possible to program more complex instructions into the fortresses.


-Snake Fortress (Grant Morrison’s 18 Days) (400CP)
Rather less ‘glorious’ than most items on this list. This is an incredibly strong, unbelievably advanced fortress, quite possibly the most advanced Yajnatek citadel ever built. Chock-full of laboratories for all kinds of research, auto-generated test subjects, with a gigantic arsenal of defenses and traps and guarded by a legion of Naga Warriors, it’s the ideal place to conduct any and all blasphemous, heretical experiment and studies one might be in the mood to engage in.


What might help is that the power of your benefactor makes it so that it’s really, staggeringly unlikely and difficult for this place to be found by anyone who would be hostile to you, be they man or god. Not impossible, but... yeah. On the other hand anyone who wants a favor or to conduct business can get here as easily as any other place. It also looks like a giant iron cobra... the whole fortress. Because of course it does.


-Orbital Refinery (Hive Queen Quest) (400CP)
 This ship is roughly a mile wide and comes stock with all the tools required to mine and refine raw ore into all manner of useable machines though its capacity is rather low, only able to produce two ships a month at most, should refined materials be fed into it the speed would likely increase somewhat while it could also be used to refine ore into ingots at an even faster rate if building machines is not required. Should you wish you could feed any scrap metal you may come across to refine it into useable materials. The refineries major downfall is that it has no ftl capability and must be towed into place, becoming largely stationary.


-Worthy Workshop (Girl Genius SB) (400CP)
The tradesman needs the right tools, don’t you know? More than that, they need the labs! You have a full set of labs, for chemical, biological, mechanical experiments, as well as any other kinds you might need. Abominable, perhaps?
These are some of the most elaborate, extensive laboratories and workshops in the world, with vast arrays of instruments and tools of the finest make, an unlimited supply of test subjects, and huge amounts of spare parts, reagents, books and journals... everything a spark needs to get going. You have just about any and all parts and reagents you might need, even things incredibly rare like water from the Dyne, and the absolute latest in all parts, of course.
Furthermore, any and all properties you have that can support them all develop similar labs and workshops, providing you a virtually unlimited collection of spaces to work from so you’re never, ever left unable to tinker to your heart’s content.


-Advanced Lab (Timespinner) (400CP)
A high-tech laboratory, kitted out with everything needed for high-end scientific exploration. It has an assembly line that can be set-up to transform raw materials into machinery via set blueprints or break down trash into raw materials, vats for cloning and developing living tissue, and offices and workspaces for general development. It is controlled and powered by a central energy core, which also doubles as a supercomputer. It can be accessed via a door in your warehouse, and can be physically inserted into a Jump and accessed directly. Finally, special spacio-temporal support buffers allow it to survive in the event of the universe ceasing to exist, and it will emergency teleport you within itself in such an event, until it is safe to emerge.


-Custom Factory (Warhammer 40k: Tau Empire) (400CP)
​This Factory complex is four stories high and covers about 100 acres of ground. It is fully automated to produce various T’au technologies, but its machines and software are modular and easily upgraded or modified to any purely mundane technologies you have the designs for and tools to build. Its output could supply weapons, armor, ammunition, mechanized armor, and miscellaneous supplies for a 50,000 ordinary T’au Fire Caste in combat, constantly, on its own, without worrying about supplies, though upgrading its technologies or providing additional raw materials could increase its output. At your discretion, this factory may be replaced with an orbital Shipyard with similar output capabilities and modularity, save for a required focus on void vessels, aerospace vessels, and the ancillary technologies required to construct them.


-Auto Shop (My Life as A Teenage Robot) (400CP)
This item is some kind of repair shop owned or otherwise freely accessible by you. The facilities here are able to repair any ​Mechanical​ device within 8 hours, including yourself, and can easily and quickly install any upgrades or technologies. And more so this shop is able to ‘reformat’ any mechanical or technological device, altering its aesthetics in any possible way and changing its basic form. When reformatting you can also have ​Mechanical​ capabilities adjusted, altering them in a “give and take” fashion. The shop can be staffed by anyone/thing you want or fully automated so long as this nature doesn’t provide noticeable advantage beyond the item’s function


-Candyland (Fantastic Four) (400CP)
What is a scientist without a worthy lab? Yours is, thankfully. Indeed, few laboratories in the world could be found that would be able to beat ​this​ place. You have a huge lab setup, probably spanning multiple floors of a huge building or a truly ridiculously sized compound on the ground, and when it comes to Science of any and all kinds, this place is as close to nirvana as it gets. It doesn’t even matter what kind of science you pursue, as the facilities here cover every single one of them. From biology to advanced astrophysics to ​psychology​, this place has the very, absolute finest facilities possible to get, millions, potentially ​billions​ of dollars worth of equipment. The quantities you have here of things depends on their rarity in the outside world, but you have an unlimited supply of everything ‘common’, including live bodies of generic non-people and animals, all up to specifications. From there the rarer something is the fewer samples you have of it, but no matter if it’s rare samples of bacteria, radioactive metals… or anything in between, this place is bound to have some​ of it, enough to make something ​good​. Everything restocks, again depending on rarity, but even the rarest samples are back in a couple months. In future worlds too, everything here, including the databanks in the computers, updates to equal levels in the local world.


-Laboratory (Batman the Animated Series) (400CP)
A large research center with millions of dollars’ worth of equipment, oriented towards any number of scientific pursuits. In addition to the equipment you also get a team of researchers, thinkers, and other scientifically minded folk that can help you with your work for you to direct. While the building follows you, the staff do not; you instead get a random assortment of new people each Jump, although their skills will be on par with their predecessors.


-Laboratory (Ben 10 0.1) (400CP)
Of course you need somewhere to work, you buffoon! What, do you think you were going to make some of the greatest wonders in the universe in some busybody’s toolshed?! Ahem. This is a fully stocked Galvan laboratory with all the tools and resources needed to do research and development. Subatomic observation platforms, computers with exabytes worth of storage, and so forth. It’s a generalist sort of facility but there’s room to add to it later if you wish to specialize.


-Black Supercomputer(Lucy) (400CP)
Everyone needs one, really. Or they should have one anyway. Unlimited storage and borderline unlimited processing power, omni-compatible I/O jacks, indestructible, immune to malware, and with crystal-clear wi-fi wherever you go, it also has the most intuitive, perfect UI imaginable and an operating system that’s magically compatible with pretty much anything you could install. You could even install an AI into the operating system if you had one available, although this item does not come with one.
It’s conveniently portable and morphs into any computing device you wish with just a thought. Mainframe workstation, pro gaming desktop, laptop, tablet, smartphone, smartwatch, whatever. Either way its functionalities remain the same even if the exact details of the UI might differ from form to form. If it’s lost or left behind, you can summon it to you with a thought. In future worlds the internet connection remains, but only to the current jump’s internet equivalent.
Lastly, it comes with a limited perception filter that guarantees that no one will notice any of the special features of your device unless you wish them to, although they will still be able to see that it’s there.
* Portable, returns to you, has SEP field
* Unlimited memory and near unlimited processing power 
* Perfect UI


-Industrial Fabber (Schlock Mercenary Rebuild) (400CP)
A massive fabber that is used for industrial applications like building starships. It can’t be hosted in a spaceship, but could help you to build your own if fed raw material from space-rocks and such. It is capable of building annie plants if given sufficient time. It comes with a full tech database of all publicly available technologies, and will update to add any new publicly available technologies in future Jumps.
* Can be used to build battleplates read: spaceships meant to tank relativistic orbital bombardments to save planets. 


-Pyramid (Assassin’s Creed Odyssey) (400CP)
A device used for computing possible futures and observing memories of the past. When a future is calculated by the relic, it provides information about the steps that need to be taken and the events that need to happen for the future to be realized. Lesser minds can end up overwhelmed by the information provided from this. The various triangles that make up its surface can be removed and held by individuals. With this version, the memories of those holding or in close contact with a triangle can be read by someone using the ‘base’ of the pyramid, even from a great distance, and future calculations can still be performed, even when a triangle is missing, though the more triangles are missing, the less precise the calculated future is. All triangles can be summoned back to the base instantly if desired.
* Computer that can do PtV lite edition


-Updation Device (Doctor Who) (400CP)
This is nice! Very nice, actually. Not quite Time Lord tech, or any other that you can tell, actually. It’s just a little something that seems to have dropped out of nowhere. But that’s not as interesting as what it does! Because what it does is really, really interesting!
This device has a very strange ability, in that it brings out the best in everything and everyone it’s used on. Use it on a machine, and it upgrades that machine to the absolute latest, best version of it that exists in any time or place in the setting. These upgrades are permanent and adapting, so if there are further improvements made in the design they’re reflected in your copy of the thing too.
But it doesn’t just work on machines. It works on people too! Used on a person, it raises them to be among the absolute 0.0001 percentile of their race and species, boosting their physical statistics, their intellect, everything. It fixes all harmful mutations, defects, or injuries, and in general improves them massively and ridiculously so they become a true, absolute exemplar of their race.
* Across all time and dimensions the best versions of something, just imagine it, how advanced could a item become by the time the universe is dying and elder races are all that is left. 


-Magic IDE (Generic Videogame Developer) (400CP)
IDE that can use any programming language and can offer improvements as well as picking out error, can make duplicate code that is compatible with different OS, and has the ability to slowly finish a program predefined by Jumper with time scaling with complexity, although its limited by hardware capability and writes the code as well as user would normally, except taking longer.


-Modelling Software (Generic Videogame Developer) (400CP)
In the modern day a lot of prototype art is done in the form of 3d models, which requires a drawing tablet and pen as well as software like Maya. While you have the tablet and pen, they are mundane. What isn’t is your custom modelling software. Not only is it perfectly designed just for your use, any 3d model you create here has the option of being 3d printed and mailed to you free of charge. So have fun with your plastic 3d printed armor.


-Tiny Manufacturing Plant (Generic Videogame Developer) (400CP)
Haven’t you always wanted to bring your imaginary tech to life? Well, this is a step in the right direction. In your possession is a machine that can create any technological device that can fit through a 1 meter x 1 meter square. All it takes is time and the schematics. Tech related to video games, such as a console, will take about an hour, while non game related tech will take an extra 3 hours, with incredibly complex technology taking even longer.


-Nanite Fabrication Table (Stargate Atlantis) (400CP)
This table has an indented, flat surface roughly the size of a coffin. It is specifically designed to assemble and program/reprogram nanite-based technology without needing clean-room conditions; if you have the right designs it could easily produce something like a nanite plague or medical nanites, and eventually produce self-replicating nanites which became the Asuran-form Replicators. However, the knowledge you will need to design and program any of these constructs must be sought elsewhere: this is merely the tool, not the craftsman.


-Augmentation Suite (Generic Cyberpunk) (400CP)
Not everybody can build a better future, but the advance of technology has made it more than possible to build a better man. These tools include those required to both maintain, service, construct, and even design or install nearly any cybernetic implant or device imaginable. Of special note is the high end fabrication capabilities that can let you throw together such devices within minutes to hours, allowing you to respond to your needs on the fly. An installation suite includes the medically sterile space necessary to perform even the most complicated or delicate operation involved, and all the requisite tools. Whether you’re setting up shop in a professional manner or servicing the more shady types out of the back of an expanded bus for dirty money, you have everything you need or could want. You may choose to have all of this connected to or fused with your warehouse. Everything replenishes and is restored in a day if destroyed, and you have a limitless supply of materials barring anything truly extraordinary which will require you to provide yourself.


-Pack-a-Punch Machine (Call Of Duty Zombies) (400CP)
Using the power of Element 115, this machine can upgrade any weapon (and I mean any!), giving it increased damage, ammo capacity, and often a special feature or two (e.g. advanced optical attachment, underbarrel grenade launcher, rapid fire mod). It’ll cost you, though.


-Fringe Institute Fab-Unit 20,000 (World of Darkness - Genius the Transgression) (400CP)
A marvel of technological wonder, and an outright Wonder at that. This device can take mundane objects and combine them together whilst maintaining the best of the two items. When used the items merge together so that it keeps the chosen properties of each, though without stacking redundant attributes. (Ex. A computer chip and a brand new superconductor would produce a new computer chip designed with the superconductor already in place. However, two nearly identical computer chips wouldn’t make a computer chip twice as good as the originals.)




-Legion Fabrication Unit (World of Darkness - Genius the Transgression) (600CP) 
The end-point for many Genius’ mass production needs is simply the beginning for you. This is a Wonder able to build other Wonders, a warehouse sized factory that accepts blueprints and raw materials and through the wonders of 3D printing, creates the finished product of whole cloth by the dozens per hour as long as it has the materials to use as a base. This facility comes with a default Air/Ground/Navy production of military automatons.
If you have Big Think they can be controlled by child AI of Big Think itself, at no risk to Big Think, to grant a huge upgrade in the self-automation of the automatons. Even better is the simplistic systems can be turned to another purpose. If the world has non-repeatable phenomena, such as magical devices in an otherwise non-magical world or technology so far beyond the norm as to be called ‘extremely improbable’, this system can analyze the structure and create a Wonder of roughly equal ability and function.
If you have A Correlation of Constants Between Physical Reality and Wondrous Artifice Creation then this ideal can be realized via the systems here as well. Allowing all Wonders created by this system to become simply mundane, though at a size and sudden need for fuel. For example a plasma pistol that could easily melt tank armored plate would find that it would need a massive battery and be around the size of an RPG.


-Research Laboratory (Warhammer 40k: Tau Empire) (600CP)
This Research Laboratory is is four stories high and covers about 100 acres of ground, and includes all of the most advanced mundane technologies of the T’au, with small sections being dedicated to various subfields in Physics, Materials Science, Chemistry, Biology, Engineering, and Computer Science, while still being modular in design and easily upgradeable or repurposed to various other fields. It will manage itself and churn out research into various mundane technologies on its own, though you can direct it to specific purposes, and will manage its own staffing, though you can hire or fire staff as you please (within limits, don’t expect to hire an entire sept to work for this lab). But moreover, this laboratory has some unique properties. Firstly, no research you perform will result in catastrophic destruction, by accident or by sabotage. No nanobots you research here will result in a Grey Goo scenario, no virus will mutate into a global pandemic, no dinosaurs will be unleashed on the public as a staffer flees with their DNA. If such research would normally result in such an issue, your staff will find that their research just stalls, failing to progress at all but not resulting in harm. And secondly, if you deign to perform research in this laboratory personally, then you, and your staff, will find your research accelerated by an order of magnitude as research cycles blaze by and prototype units roll out of machine shops far more quickly than possible, so long as you personally spend at least 40 man-hours a week performing research of some kind, with lesser boosts available if you spend less time contributing to the labs productivity.


-Handy Workshop(Satisfactory-factorio Gauntlet) (600CP)
This Equipment Workshop provides you with the tools and materials needed to upgrade any equipment you have. However, you must have a well-defined, finite end goal for the equipment, and you need to be undisturbed while using it. Extensive goals require extensive amounts of time, and you might be better served looking for better materials than brute-forcing a far-reaching goal with limited materials.
You can only get materials that are duplicates of some you already have, in infrastructure or a system you already have, or just in storage or on your person. Other people using this only get the tools, not the free materials. Can be installed in your Warehouse or attached to an Imported property in future Jumps. If destroyed while Imported, reverts to being part of the Warehouse.


-Workshop of the Future (Generic Cyberpunk) (600CP)
What you could make if only you had the tools. It’s a lamentation that you’ll never find yourself making ever again. This absolute masterpiece of a workspace is large enough that even a megacorp wouldn’t find it lacking, either in space or capability, capable of hosting every pursuit or project you care to imagine and often many of those at once. Most unique however is the impossibly nuanced automation that has been worked into it’s countless systems and utilities. Even the most exacting genius or craftsman would find no reason to fault letting the systems here do the work for them, allowing them to focus entirely on pushing the boundaries and leaving grunt work to the machines. These systems effectively share your crafting skills and abilities including the effects of perks. If you’ve purchased the Augmentation Suite and/or Keys to the Matrix then they are seamlessly integrated, and with the Personal Arm Computer the entire sight could be managed trivially from it’s interface. May be either an actual facility or attached to your warehouse. Comes with a limitless stock of raw materials and resources barring the truly extraordinary, same as the Augmentation Suite. Whatever tools or functions it lacks can easily be built with what is here if needed. Never suffer for tools again.


-Archology (Battle Action Harem Highschool Side Character Quest) (600CP)
You own a medium size archology that comes equipped with standard defenses and a Higgs generator as a power supply. The millions that call your arcology home live in a post-scarcity like state thanks to modern technology taking care of their essential needs. The arcology comes with an individual already synched to the Valkyrie Core at its heart who manages its everyday functions. If you also possess a simulator room or the high energy physics lab you may have them integrated into the arcology if you wish.


-Warchive (Revelation space) (600CP) 
An ignorant fool would call the warchive an arsenal, 'a place to store weapons', as evidenced by the quantity of guns displayed on the walls of this room, but it's also so very much more. The warchive contains a coffin-sized fabricator and an advanced database containing every personal weapon that humanity has developed in this universe, in its thousands of years of violence. From a combat knife to an ack-am launcher to a camouflaged assassin's needler, this fabricator can not only manufacture any handheld weapon it has the schematics for, but it can also merge and customize their functions, appearances, programming and ergonomics to any user's vague, general or very specific requirements. It comes equipped with a knowledgeable gamma-level personality to interpret your requests and offer suggestions. You'll get to specify the personality, so you don't get annoyed by it. The warchive will automatically acquire the blueprints of any weapons you currently possess or acquire to add to its collection, with the stipulation that it cannot reproduce enchantments or other added magical effects, and you may have to supply a bit of raw material and some of the rarer components yourself (like antimatter or setting-specific materials like kryptonite, eezo or uru). The warchive takes up a room which may be placed in your warehouse, a large starship or another property. Naturally, you can restrict access to the warchive.


-Manufactory (Revelation space) (600CP)
When lighthuggers and habitats need to repair themselves, the large-scale manufactories are where the parts are designed and produced. This manufactory is roughly on par with that of a well-to-do Glitter Band habitat, and on its own is the size of several skyscrapers packed tightly together. Running at peak efficiency, it’s capable of assembling 1,000 tons of raw material into finished products per minute – provided, of course, you have the right kinds of raw materials, correct blueprints to assemble them into, and a logistics chain to keep it all working smoothly. In the hands of an inefficient human, it might top out at 100 tons/minute. It is incapable of atomic transmutation and having to ‘crack’ raw matter into a different type will slow everything down a bit (eg: throwing in methane (CH4) to crack into carbon and hydrogen, when you need the carbon to make diamond, rather than using pure carbon to begin with). It is capable of producing nanotech (such as quickmatter) at a much smaller rate, owing to the processes involved. The Manufactory comes pre-installed with blueprints for just about any item in common use in Yellowstone space; you’ll have to obtain prohibited or classified blueprints for yourself. You will have to manually configure and program it to work with any unusual materials.


-A Hidden Base (Arpeggio of Blue Steel) (600CP)
This tropical island houses a secret facility with all the facilities of a modern shipyard: underground docks for submarines or other submersible craft to enter by, comfortable living quarters and rooms for planning operations, stockpiles of nanomaterials, an underground mine for extracting raw materials, and even a fantastic beach. While it seems idyllic, it is far from defenceless: concealed turrets, Klein field generators, missile tubes and more lie in wait for any attacker. Its defences can be overwhelmed eventually, however, so I wouldn’t rely on them against a sophisticated foe. Expended consumables, like nanomaterials, resupply on a weekly basis. This island imports into a suitably remote position in a tropical ocean in each jump.


-Omnium (Overwatch) (600CP)
Oh, how interesting. You seem to have come into the possession of your own personal Omnium. These self-improving automated robotic factories are the source of the omnic population of the world and were very nearly the instrument of humanity’s ruin during the first Crisis. You may have the factory create omnics for you as is its purpose, though you will need to supply the materials necessary for doing so. You may also fully customize the appearance, personality, intelligence level, and capabilities of your creations – though if the specifications are too far removed from basic omnics, you will need to supply the necessary designs for them.


-UAC Mars Facility (DOOM 3 V1.0) (800CP)
One of the most advanced scientific research stations in the solar system, the UAC’s Mars facilities work on everything from energy production and terraforming to Archaeology and teleportation. It is one of the pinnacles of human achievement… and now, it is yours. Or at least, a copy of it is - perhaps one far enough away from the original that it’s safe from the coming demonic invasion?
Coming with a full complement of (mostly) competent staff as well as a wide variety of interesting technologies, the facility now operates under your command. Whether you decide to take a more active hand in their research or simply leave them to their own interests, they’re guaranteed to come up with interesting ideas over time - usually in areas involving physics, weapons development, and so on. In future worlds, you’ll likewise become the owner of a large, productive center of scientific learning, though it doesn’t need to be on Mars as such.

Magical Personal Toolkits
These are magical items used by a single person, be it a tool upto a single craft bench. These are only items that used to make/work on purely magical gear. If the tool has a magical feature from the perk, but is otherwise not magical in nature or function, put it under another category. Do not include items that grant fiat or other effects on gear, unless it is otherwise magical.






-Transposing Kiln (Dark Souls 3) (50CP)
An old transposing kiln from Courland, crafted with stitched crystal lizard hide. This kiln can transpose twisted souls to craft special items with their concentrated essence. Deemed forbidden by those unable to make proper use of it.


-Art Set (A 'Happy' Harry Potter Fanfiction) (50CP)
 A full art kit stored in a small expanded carry case for all your drawing or painting needs. Comes with a small paint can that can change to different colored infinite paint, both indoor and outdoor options, never dries out if left open, and doesn't get contaminated by dirt or other colors left on the brush. Chalk, pencils, and crayons won't break, require sharpening, or be used up. Drawing pages or canvas can be changed to other types and will never run out with the finished picture being saved to your folder, and brushes will never degrade or get bent, broken bristles nor run out if they're lost or pulled.
The brushes come in a range of sizes from the wide indoor wall painter to the tiniest canvas detailer. Pencils, crayons, and chalk are much the same as are the colored varieties. A pack of special white erasers are included, ranging from small to large, that don't wear down or spread the erased material but can nevertheless undo any of your drawn or painted projects if necessary. The case and all its inventory can be found in your warehouse if lost, stolen, or destroyed.


-Etching Pen  (A 'Happy' Harry Potter Fanfiction)  (100CP) 
A specialized etching tool that can carve stone, wood, metal, or other hardened surfaces like a hot knife through butter or switch to a regular pen that can write on any softer surfaces such as rice paper. The tool is capable of erasing any damages it causes, reversing inked mistakes, and even absorbing certain fluids like blood, acid, ink, or venom to write with. The tool will always be sharp and never run out of whatever fluid it has currently Absorbed.


-Armor-Shift Manufacture (Bloody Roar) (100CP) 
A small machine - big enough to hold a massive pauldron or two - that gives any pieces of armor or clothing placed inside a specific quality: When their wearer changes form, the armor and clothing changes form with them.


-Magic Cooking Pot (The Legend of Zelda Breath of the Wild) (100CP)
A simple iron pan, that can magically light a fire underneath itself when set up. Even when off of a fire, it will heat items placed in it to the desired temperature. All meals and elixirs cooked on it will receive a boost in quality, and can provide a variety of beneficial effects, depending on the ingredients used. Magically provides a comfortable temperature nearby when in use.


-Carving kit (Diablo 1&2) (100CP)
The tools within this leather satchel are of exceptional quality and have been ritually prepared for work with delicate magical reagents. Having these will make Gemcutting and runecarving much easier. A sheaf of paper in a waterproof scroll case notes useful details on several basic runes and the most common semi-precious gems, but it lacks details on multi-rune sequences and the rarest stones. Still, the papers make a good reference, and they will automatically update themselves when your discover now information through experimentation or research. If lost or destroyed, the kit will reappear in your possession the next day


-Tools of the Trade (Nexus) (100CP)
A worker isn’t much without their tools, and so, you have a wide array of tools and equipment usable to make whatever you might wish to make. This includes a rather large work space connected to your warehouse.
* This setting is magical in nature so this is tools to make magical gear.


-Traveling Toolkit (Girl Genius SB) (100CP)
And an excellent set, too! This is a full set of incredibly high quality, very much portable tools suited for just about any purposes you may need them for, especially for repurposing existing or enemy works! Just the thing any scientist would need for Sparking on the go!


-Crafting Table (Minecraft) (100CP)
You can easily assemble a few planks into a crafting table, upon which you can nigh­instantly produce almost anything, so long as you have all the parts and know the recipe. Items larger than a 1m3 cube, or which are not designed to be worn on your person or carried in your hand, may require more advanced crafting techniques, but you’ll still find it easier to make the parts for it. Complex items usually require a bunch of sub­parts, and figuring out all the recipes for them can be difficult.


-Wiring Gear (Terraria - Journey's End) (200CP)
A set of wrenches and a few hundred feet of wire that can be used to connect various switches, pressure plates, and buttons to objects to control them or direct power to them. Comes with a few basic switches and plates, and instructions on how to make more, as well as a Mechanical Lens that can help you to see connecting wires. The wire restocks within a day. For an undiscounted extra 100 CP, this also comes with instructions on how to make teleporters, which can be wired together to transport whatever is on them between each other when activated.


-Silver Needles of Intricate Design (Exalted - The Lunars) (200CP)
This set of moonsilver needles is special in a very particular way, as it literally cannot do otherwise than perform good tattoo procedures. If you attempted to stab someone’s chest with one of these needles, it would twist and shape itself such that you've just marked a simple design on their skin. Each a perfect instrument to tattoo the body, these needles provide a potent tool for the use of body decorations. Making even the most elegant and complex patterns and designs easy to apply for the one who uses these, as they innately correct even the slightest mistake their user makes. Moreover, their use will never cause infection or injury, and the surface of the tattoo will seal over nearly instantly after it is applied. 


Along with the needles themselves, you will also receive a supply of many different mundane inks of exceptional quality. Though of course the needles can also be used with various other inks you might be able to acquire. They can handle anything, from the mundane ones to sorcerous inks to tattoo occult sigils, to chalcanth used to create living demon-ink tattoos, to stranger substances still, and even the moonsilver ink used to create the Moonsilver Tattoos and various tattoo artifacts. That last one in particular resonates with the Silver Needles, for when they are used with moonsilver ink, they may cause the Moonsilver Tattoos to become temporarily fluid and accept new tattoo artifacts to be inscribed upon the skin of their wearer.
* For mundane and magic tattoo crafting at any level




-Horadric Malus (Diablo 1&2) (200CP)
An ancient and heavily-enchanted hammer, this tool was built to aid in forging magical items. In layman's terms it regulates and stabilizes magical energies, preventing small mishaps, foreign mana flows, short pauses in the enchanting process and other such problems from ruining an enchanter's work. While items produced with the aid of the Malus are only slightly more powerful, they are much more resistant to mystical tampering and corruption.


-Horadric Cube (Diablo 1&2) (200CP)
A copy of an ancient artifact created by the mage clans, which was itself a copy of an even older device, this engraved cube is a potent tool of alchemy and transformation. The cube's four most common uses are to repair, refine, transmute, or dismantle items. The cube can repair broken magical items to full functionality, though you may need to add in reagents to make up for lost mass and energy. Multiple items of the same type placed inside will be consumed to create a single slightly more potent version. Items can be transmuted into other items of a different shape yet similar nature, such as arrows into bolts. Finally, magical items can be fragmented, enchantments and power cleanly divided between each piece, a function commonly used to store dangerous items in a more manageable form.


-Master Alchemical Apparatus (Morroblivion) (200CP)
A Master Mortar and Pestle, Calcinator, Alembic and Retort allowing for greater quantities of much better quality potions.


-Golden Sickle (Asterix the Gaul) (200CP)
​This is a sickle made of solid gold, perfect for harvesting materials with magical properties. So perfect, that it has properties of its own. Firstly, any materials harvested using this sickle will never go bad. Food doesn’t rot, meat, if you somehow used it on that, doesn’t go rancid, magical herbs don’t lose their powers. Secondly, it tends to have the exact magical properties you need to harvest any and all magical substances, without too much of a fuss. In essence, you can replace any and all growing and harvesting requirements for an ingredient, like ‘needs to see the moon twenty times’, or ‘dance naked under at twilight carrying a pitcher of water that you then sprinkle’ with ‘cut using this sickle’. Doesn’t apply on the super rare, absolutely one-of-a-kind stuff, mind you. It must be at least somewhat common.


-Precision Tools (God Catching Alchemy Meister) (200CP)
Exactly what it says on the tin. A collection of the best tools used to perform the local Alchemy. From chisels to mixing sets and other useful trinkets. While you probably already have or can get the minimum required tools to perform Alchemy in shops, this comes with upgrades adding more tools every jump you visit, provided that version of "Alchemy" involves adding magical properties to regular processes.


-SCP 914’s Manual (SCP Foundation) (400CP)
This book is kind of... stupidly thin for what it claims to be. Really, it's hard-covered and barely a quarter-inch thick, and it has, "SCP-914," embossed on the front of it in gold-leaf. Opening it and flipping through it shows why it's this thin: It's probably been passed through 914 on, "Very Fine," itself; you can easily turn past the seeming end of the book without any trouble. Contained in its pages are instructions for making your own instance of SCP-914 and even hooking it into your Warehouse's utilities if you have any, an explanation of what each of the settings does, in excruciating detail, how to effectively combine items, and even how to care for it and repair one if damaged. It is recommended not to put sapient creatures through it, on any of the settings, in dozens of places inside the manual, but those are obviously just recommendations.


-Philosopher's Stone (DC Occult) (400CP)
A perfect replica of the Philosopher's Stone, one of the Four Wonders of Alchemy. Legendary even outside of occult circles and widely sought after, the Philosopher's Stone is the ultimate goal of every alchemist to ever live. The small stone possesses the ability to alter the molecular structure of inorganic matter into other elements.


-Unique Uniques (Modded Skyrim) (400CP)
You know, is there really a point to making haxcalibur if it looks the same as any other broadsword? That's just a waste. Thats where this thing comes in! It's a small ring with a black stone embedded. Wearing it will allow you to visually reskin any customized, special, unique, or otherwise non ordinary weapon, armor, or item you can get your hands on. Your choice if said change is retroactive.


-The Crockpot of the Gods (IOU) (400CP)
It might be messy, but it’s a cheap way of covering up a fatal experiment. This large black pot will reconstitute the body of any once-living material placed inside it… as long as it’s pureed first. It’s recommended that foreign objects be removed first and that only one life form be restored at once. The process takes about a day and can work even with a body reduced to ashes (adding water is advisable in this case).


-Eternal Flame (Everyone Else is a Returnee) (600CP)
An inextinguishable and living flame that can continuously grow. This flame is precious even within Heaven. The more flames and magic stones it is fed, the stronger and hotter it becomes. This flame has a high level of intelligence, akin to that of a human. This flame is extremely useful for the processing of general materials and ores as even if it cannot process them immediately, it can eventually grow to the point where it can. Additionally, as this flame grows, it may become useful in other ways. Yu Ilhan incorporated the Eternal Flame into several of his items to boost the strength of their attack.


-The Mixing Cauldron | Melting Pot | Spirit Pyroxene | Goldberg Formula | Daisy Chain | The Vortex  (Atelier: Arland Trilogy) (600CP) 
The Mixing Cauldron (100CP) Every Alchemists’ trusty tool, the mixing cauldron is basically the alchemist’s work desk and research station combined into one. With this, no potion is out of reach –though it isn’t uncommon to find that some alchemists’ will create...other things from their cauldrons, and one would be foolish to presume that a cauldron can’t be improved... 
Melting pot (100CP) It’s not uncommon to find that certain ingredients will not mix well just as attempting to stack too many enchantments into a potion can prove disastrous. In an attempt to mitigate this, the melting pot was constructed with a higher rate of mixing. This directly translates to a higher degree of homogenization, but you’ll have to understand that to maintain this level of mixing you need to have a higher energy source than just a fire under the cauldron. It does allow you to blend some ingredients that normally would not mix however, though the results may still not be as optimal as you would hope. 
Spirit Pyroxene (100CP): No one quite knows where this pyroxene came from, but it has a very definitive effect on the items that it forms a component of. The mystical power inside the pyroxene seems to carry over into the items that it forms –at least a portion of the power does, and the crafted items became more conductive towards spiritual magic of a large variety. 
Goldberg Formula (100CP): There are times when making things overly complex can be problematic. Then there are times when making things overly complex can be outright awesome. Your cauldron really shouldn’t be called a cauldron anymore. Synthesis isn’t a matter of tossing in ingredients and brewing. Your cauldron is a part of a system, a large chain of components and contraptions which ultimately will create a potion – likely of higher quality. But you’ll likely have no clue how it works. Due to the nature of this set up, you’ll find that the cauldron will follow along with you in a containment chamber of its own – and though it initially resembles a cottage...should the contraption chain grow bigger (and it will!) the cottage will also increase in size. 
Daisy Chain (100CP): Interested in large scale alchemy? Well, between this and a core reactor, you’ll have yourself a veritable alchemy workshop. Granted, in reality this just sets up a series of mini cauldrons which will automatically adopt specific arrangements to facilitate more complex, multi-tiered synthesis reactions – but it’ll boost your synthesis rates immensely, and ensure that easier recipes won’t fail! Of course...you could have each cauldron act autonomously – but really they work best in unison with every other unit. Due to the number of cauldrons created, a large part of the containment chamber is occupied by cauldrons as they move about and get down to business. Thankfully, you can still move about and organize the cauldrons – though they’re a fair bit more autonomous than before. Each cauldron seems to exhibit the same effects as your original cauldron, and it isn’t out of the realm of possibility to add more cauldrons – though it’ll be a time consuming process. 
The Vortex (100CP): The amount of energy required to keep this going will be tremendous, but if you toss anything into there – it will blend. Instead of functioning like a batch system, the Cauldron operates continually, and will actively remember the last effect from the last ingredient which was put in. It’s also possible for it to store an effect, but this requires you to have a constant supply of the reagent necessary to provide that effect. A cauldron useful for expert alchemists, one should take care if this is combined with any other extensive modifications.


-The Black Cauldron (A 'Happy' Harry Potter Fanfiction) (600CP) 
Yes, that one but a much more user friendly version. A magical indestructible cauldron in which any potion can be brewed to perfection even if the actual results produce a failed solution. With this you'll have no need for silver, gold, brass, or any other type of metal made pot to create your elixirs in and it can be set to produce an infinite amount of whatever potion is made in it until you require another. The cauldron will also eat any sludge left over so that the inside is clean when you next need to use it. The cauldron will produce an undead army on command with the proper chant or revive one person per year to full life and health. Is enchanted to be featherlight so you can lift it without strain.Comes with a complete index of ingredients, their properties, and reactions when mixed, which updates with each world in their own section, as well as a high quality alchemical master's potions kit with all magical and common alchemical ingredients, all the tools and stirring implements to prepare them, plus twenty unbreakable vials, as well as protective gear. The tools are self maintaining and the ingredients self replenishing. A set of fifteen unbreakable empty vials are included which when filled with a potion of your choice will continue to produce that potion ex nihilo, so pick your choices with care. Finally, the whole ensemble can be found in the warehouse if lost or stolen. Includes A small case with a compartment that has a replenishing store of a range of potion regents. Such regents replenish once every two weeks and come in reasonable quantities. Does not contain any extremely rare ingredients.


-Stone Censer of Reunion (Desolate Era II) (800CP)
The original Stone Censer of Reunion was a potent artifact, however this version has been fine tuned to the extreme. Its first effect is that those in the range of its incense enter a state of enlightenment equal to those random moments and epiphanies, except for however long the incense lasts. Which is now forever, meaning it may even be used in a space-time acceleration treasure.
* Unlimited enlightenment and epiphanies at the level of a multiverse level cultivation world

Magical Facilities
These are magical facilities, be them several craft benches to entire buildings. These are only for pure magical facilities for working on magic, not something that is ‘magical’ because of its fiat backing or other perk effects it grants to items it makes.






-House of the Witch (Fate Legends: Empire of Antiquity) (100CP)
Every young witch’s favourite birthday present, at least until they know how to make it themselves. This small house is rather rudimentary when it comes to living necessities but quite filled out in regards to potion making. Not only does it have a high quality set of tools and appliances towards creating potions, poisons and designing magical rituals, it also comes with a weekly replenishing stock of low to mid range potions in the pantry. From youth restoring drinks, potions to plump or slim down the form, some love potions and even a few useful for combat potions that can temporarily improve strength and speed. The house also always has a fresh batch on pancakes ready on the stove, covered in your choice of delicious topping


-Alchemy Workshop (Endless Legend) (100CP)
 Build into a wagon, this full scale workshop allows for scientific  research in the field, and provides all the tools the aspiring researcher needs to learn about the world they are in. Just don't blow yourself up or blind anyone, ok?
* Not many of that workshops are mobile


-Alchemist’s Laboratory (Overlord:Light novel) (100CP)
A fully fitted and supplied alchemist’s laboratory ready for your use. It comes with the highest quality supplies and equipment required to make magical potions, allowing you to make potions to emulate the effect of any spell you know that could be reasonably made into a potion via alchemy (assuming you know alchemy, at least). The equipment will automatically upgrade itself relative to your own personal skill level, so the more skilled you are the better it will be to reflect that. Reagents for common potions restock themselves automatically on a regular basis.
For 100 CP however the reagents for rare and much higher quality potions will restock themselves, and additionally a store-front will be added to the front of your laboratory, allowing you to profit from your efforts. The 100 CP version also comes with a sales clerk and an alchemist of exceptional talent if still within reasonable limits (read: not Realm of Heroes or Level One Hundred) whom will produce and sell potions for you. You get potions for free, and get a cut of all profits the store makes. The laboratory, sales clerk, and alchemist will follow you jump to jump, although the clerk and alchemist aren’t the same people jump-to-jump (unless you purchase the Guild Base option, in which case they can be if they are part of the Guild Base). No one will question the presence of this store or the potions it makes, even in places or worlds where it would be highly irregular. You get to choose where the laboratory is located in this and future jumps. 50cp version free for those with the Alchemist innate talent, and Alchemists need only pay 50cp to get the 100cp version.


-Auto-smelter (Azeroth) (100CP) 
This Auto-Smelter will smelt down any raw ore placed inside it into high quality ingots. This smelter is completely hands free, except for actually placing the ore inside. For further incentive, if you purchased The Mine you will be given a group of magical constructs who will mine your ore, place it in the Auto-Smelter, then sort out the finished product. They can not be used for anything outside of their primary functions stated above.


-Portable Examination Station (Van Helsing) (150CP)
A portable study centre - magnifying glass, vials, all held within a tightly-locked briefcase. As well, comes with a variety of supernatural samples - from vials of different blood types of demons and werewolves, to vampire fangs, demonic horn shavings, ghoul teeth, and ectoplasm from a great variety of undead.




-Ding! (Girl Genius SB) (200CP)
Well, this is different. A certain gentleman called Von Neumann would be delighted, at least. You are now the proud master of a full set of Dingbots of your own, or similar clanks or drones, at least. They’re all minor sparks in their own rights, and can themselves build more of their kind, even though those don’t have the spark.
Led by a Prime, they are connected with you on an intrinsic, mental level, being fully capable of building any and all devices or works you can. They get everywhere, performing construction upkeep, salvage and everything else you might need them to. Not even needing blueprints, they seem to draw upon your knowledge directly, using their in-built tools to perform all the things you normally would need to do yourself, making everything you’d like them to... and a lot of them you wouldn’t.
Don’t leave them unsupervised.


-Delfire Forge (Ravenwood) (200CP)
Actually three items. A single, moderately powerful orb of delfire, a metal frame that can store an orb of delfire and allow the one that holds it to use the orb without being a kiln, and a large furnace that, if you plug the frame into it while it holds an orb of delfire, can be used to treat metals with arcane energy while also acting as a forge.


-Alchemy Workshop (Minecraft) (200CP)
This small room has only a workbench and a chest that hold a miscellany of reagents and alchemy supplies. The chest will provide a small but steady supply of glass vials, water, and nether wart, the things which form the basis of all Minecraft potions. Occasionally when opened the chest will also have a small amount of glowstone, redstone, or gunpower for use. Post-jump, the chest will update to provide a similar supply of anything a world's alchemy absolutely requires to get started, along with small amounts of random low-level ingredients.


-Magical Laboratory (World Seed) (200CP):
Now this is a fitting lab for an aspiring scientist, mad or not. It has all the tools and equipment needed to contain and study any kind of magical creature and phenomenon, or to bring arcane secrets of the universe to light. And should you ever not have the right machinery at hand for whatever you want to do, the lab will upgrade itself and produce what you need in an instant. Now, the only thing holding you back will be the limits of your own intelligence. After this jump, it will attach itself to your warehouse, and may appear in any location you desire in other worlds you might visit.


-Coding Station (The Irregular At The Magic Highschool) (200CP)
This is the workhorse of a Magic Engineer, being their main ‘battle station’ so to speak. This large desk comes equipped with an integrated computer and CAD connection system to code Sequences into CADs and tune them to their user. It also possesses a simple VI system to make coding easier and more efficient. Includes a CAD can take almost any form you want, from a bracelet to a pendant to a stick,
and store up to 99 different Activation Sequences though it’s usually less precise than a specialized CAD.


-Deplorable Forge of Tormented Souls (Exalted - The Abyssals) (200CP)
Proper soulforging is a highly specialized art that requires rarified equipment, access to Labyrinthine materials and a willingness on the part of the soulsmith to condemn another ghost to eternal torment. While the willingness to do so must come from yourself, almost everything else can be bought right here, providing you with equipment and inexhaustible supplies of the raw materials ones need to forge a soul into steel.
Full usage of the craft requires artifacts to forge the metal, a hammer and anvil composed of soulsteel or jade (whichever you prefer) to hammer the molten ghost-alloys into shape, another artifact known as an Essence-forge to melt down the unfortunate ghost’s corpus and other materials, soulfire crystals replete with essence to stoke the forge, and black ores taken from the Labyrinth to grant it the ghastly, magical strength of soulsteel.
Even the alchemical agents, wrought from the Labyrinth, which are needed to create the rarefied void-coated plates of Oblivion’s Panoply are in refilling supplies amongst these, should you have need of them. With this, the only thing you would still require for your dread craft is a supply of souls to feed your forge.
* The new CF has some souls available in supplies that can be used guilt free. 


- Ars Creation Tools (BlazBlue) (200CP)
Tools required to make Ars Magus and Ars Armagus. Without these, creating such things would be impossible, because creating the converter to let the user manipulate Seithr requires these specialized tools for the process to work properly.
* The doc contains a knowledge perk to use the tool, rember to remove both together if you decide not to keep them


-Alchemy Machine (Spiral Knights) (200CP) 
A personal Variation of the machine you'll come to see all over cradle. This one allows for a degree of experimentation that none of the other machines will, and is capable of accepting a great variety of materials without taking any damage. You'll be able to tweak existing recipes, or even come up with new ones altogether with enough time. Who knows, you might stumble on something good.


-Castle Jumper (Marvel Magic) (200CP)
​What is the point of living if you don’t do it in style? Certainly, you know the importance of aesthetics even in the face of practicality... but that does not mean that something can’t be both stylish and practical. You are the proud owner of a large european castle. It’s practically straight out of a storybook, having stone walls, great towers -- hell, the thing even has a moat. However, despite its ancient appearance, it is fully updated to the modern times. Possessing everything from standard amenities such as running water and electricity to a state-of-the-art security system and laboratories. The way you live should make a statement, a fact that you seem to understand very well.
* This is the only laboratory that is state of the art that comes from Marvel comics. Not the movies like the Fantastic Four CandyLand. Let me repeat that. This is the only state of the art laboratory from Marvel comics.
* Marvel comic ‘state of the art’ is absurdly stronger than the movies so might be worth to keep.

​Being​ ​constantly​ ​on​ ​the​ ​move,​ ​Source​ ​Hunters​ ​are​ ​forced​ ​to​ ​find ways​ ​to​ ​ensure​ ​they​ ​have​ ​the​ ​tools​ ​of​ ​their​ ​craft​ ​even​ ​when​ ​far​ ​from​ ​their​ ​headquarters.​ ​This​ ​set of​ ​three​ ​small,​ ​metal​ ​charms​ ​are​ ​relics​ ​of​ ​an​ ​age​ ​past​ ​that​ ​were​ ​confiscated​ ​and​ ​put​ ​to​ ​better use.​ ​By​ ​pulling​ ​one​ ​off​ ​the​ ​chain​ ​that​ ​binds​ ​them,​ ​an​ ​easy​ ​act​ ​when​ ​one​ ​actually​ ​desires​ ​it,​ ​the holder​ ​can​ ​have​ ​what​ ​they​ ​require.​ ​Place​ ​the​ ​charm​ ​on​ ​the​ ​ground​ ​and​ ​a​ ​Forge​ ​springs​ ​into existence,​ ​hot​ ​and​ ​ready​ ​to​ ​be​ ​used.​ ​Or​ ​a​ ​campfire​ ​crackling​ ​cheerfully​ ​and​ ​ready​ ​to​ ​warm​ ​the air.​ ​The​ ​final​ ​charm​ ​is​ ​a​ ​Workbench,​ ​which​ ​includes​ ​a​ ​grinding​ ​wheel​ ​and​ ​all​ ​the​ ​small​ ​tools​ ​a budding​ ​alchemist​ ​might​ ​need​ ​to​ ​construct​ ​grenades,​ ​arrows,​ ​or​ ​even​ ​the​ ​smaller​ ​magical charms.​ ​By​ ​touching​ ​the​ ​small​ ​symbol​ ​etched​ ​into​ ​each,​ ​they​ ​will​ ​revert​ ​back​ ​to​ ​their​ ​charm​ ​form and​ ​hop​ ​back​ ​onto​ ​the​ ​chain​ ​in​ ​an​ ​instant.​ ​Should​ ​you​ ​accidently​ ​lose​ ​one​ ​or​ ​be​ ​forced​ ​to​ ​leave one​ ​behind,​ ​it​ ​will​ ​reappear​ ​on​ ​the​ ​chain​ ​at​ ​the​ ​next​ ​full​ ​moon


-Enchanting Board (Scooby Gamers) (200CP)
You have a certified enchanting board. Not only does it allow multiple people to pool their mana in order to fuel the enchanting process, every person that donates mana to the project also gains the same amount of ‘experience’ as the person doing the enchanting. Enchantments made to things using this board are guaranteed to be more effective than they would be with a normal enchanting board.


-Artifact Forge(Azeroth) (200CP)
 This forge grants you every appearance in game of your Artifact Weapon and allows you to alter the appearance of your weapon at any time. In future Jumps it will allow you to alter the function of your weapon at any time. Turning swords into spears or axes into daggers. I’ll even allow you to use it to change a pistol into a rifle, or something similar. The forge will also serve as a medium allowing you to more easily enchant and create powerful weapons which you can imbue with powerful magical effects.


-The Armoire of Abiele (World of Darkness - Werewolf the Apocalypse) (200CP)
This exceptionally crafted antique mahogany French Armoire was crafted at some point during the 19th century by Abiele Dumont, a famed fashion designer so that she’d always be fabulously dressed. Whispering your clothing desire into the keyhole then turning the key allows you to pull out a fabulous outfit made of the finest spider silk. The outfits fit perfectly and are quite comfortable.


-Skyforge (The Elder Scrolls: Skyrim) (200CP) 
An ancient, mysterious, eagle themed forge added to your warehouse. Any metal items crafted at the forge will be significantly harder and stronger for it. Something about the fires.


-Workshop Equipment (Bloodborne) (300CP) 
This is actually a package deal containing a variety of workshop tools. The first tool set has some basic tools for repairing equipment and some more specialized tools for upgrading weaponry with varying Blood Stones. The second set of tools allows for the slotting and removal of Blood Gems, items that as previously mentioned can greatly empower weaponry. The last set of tools allows you to etch Caryll Runes into the mind to attain their wondrous strength, or remove them just as easily. Runesmith Caryll, student of Byrgenwerth, transcribed the inhuman utterings of the Great Ones into what are now called Caryll Runes. Etching these runes into your mind can provide a number of benefits. Benefits can range from resisting certain types of damage, increasing resistance to various poisons or increasing stamina and vitality, among other effects. You may etch up to three runes into your mind at a time. These runes can be found scattered around this world.
* Enhance weapons by slotting in blood gems
* Transcribe eldritch god utterings into your mind for powers 


-Nine Elements Cauldron (Desolate Era I) (300CP)
A cauldron that is typically used to melt down treasures for their elemental essence, so that someone can then repurpose them into forging a new treasure that is even stronger than the many that were melted down. Unlike others, however, this one seems to be able to melt down items of any level, and can remember the traits of any treasures it melts down and apply them to other items.


-Wizard’s Lab (Dresden Files) (300CP)
More of an add-on than your own separate living space, this can either be built into a Residence you own, or add a trapdoor to your Warehouse and store it underneath. It comes equipped with everything you need for magical experiments short of a stuffed crocodile hanging from the ceiling: A built-in summoning circle, shelf after shelf of weird reagents and knick-knacks, a small library of interesting books about magic and the supernatural, and an actual laboratory for making potions and enchanting objects. It's also been heavily reinforced, so any failures or spills will at worst blacken the floors.


-Ritual Room (Highschool DxD) (300CP)
It’s a little difficult to practice complex magical formulas in public, so you came prepared. This is a room styled to your preferred magic system of choice, and all magic you personally perform within this room will enjoy both greater efficiency in mana and greater power. Also comes with spooky robes and basic ritual equipment and reagents for free.


-Crafting Stations (Terraria - Journey's End) (300CP)
Crafting Stations Stations that are used with your ability to craft items. Each of them is easily collapsible with your inventory ability. The first Crafting Station purchase for the Crafter is Discounted.

-Volcanic Forge (God of War) (300CP)
The Smith God's power is great, but it is not by his will alone that his works are forged. There is also his tools to consider, and with this you have one such tool.
Attached to your Warehouse is a small volcano, a fiery beast that will never fade and never falter. Its power is great, reducing the time you need to break down metals and minerals, reworking them into new forms while increasing their quality and inherent strengths. Should you choose, you may also take a significant hit in forging time to experiment with different metals and minerals, melting and combining them to create a different, newer resource with one quality from the second object in question. Rise, craftsman. Rise and begin your work.


-Mystical Forge (Jade Empire) (300CP)
You have obtained a forge capable of creating gems, as well as upgrading any of your weapons to their fullest potential. The staff known as Golden Star can become Tien’s Justice, the sword known as Fortune’s Favorite can become the Demon Sword. Furthermore, this forge can upgrade your own weapons, increasing the skill it takes to use them, but enhancing their abilities by 50% ... provided you are willing to think of a cool name and backstory for them. The forge is a stickler for tradition.
* It’s Gem creation ability is mostly useless,but adding a empowering backstory to a weapon is cool


-Tower of Sorcerae|Floating Isle|Moving Locations|Arcane|Sorcerae|A Memory Of The Face Of Creation (Lords of the Night - Liches) (300CP)
Tower of Sorcerae (100CP): You have a tower dreamt into reality. Maybe by you, maybe by someone else, but it was never made a concrete and defined thing. It starts out a thing the size of a city block, and thirty stories high. It can be something of stone, or glass, or crystal, or wood. When no one is watching it, it can change its outer facade. Inside it has a basic layout, though you can change that layout whenever it is unobserved by people other than you. Both the inside and out will repair themselves over time, and the tower may slowly shift itself, faster if unobserved, though still slowly.
The tower echoes any crafting perks you possess, gaining technologies and magics in keeping with the secrets and arts you’ve seized. You may feed the tower vast quantities of Arcane over time to make it grow. You may make it grow in luxury, making everything inside the tower higher quality over time and more comfortable and beautiful. You may make it grow in utility causing it to grow embedded magical items, and if you have the perks, technological ones. You may make it grow in size, becoming broader or taller or both, or even make it grow inside without growing outside, though that’s even more expensive.
If you make the Tower a bound artifact, all those functions will be enhanced. You can also have it already on legs, or other appropriate mechanisms, so that it can move about. You may import an existing property as your Tower, though if that combination would be especially powerful you must pay an extra 100cp for the privilege.
Floating Isle (100CP): Your Tower flies, and so does a modest amount of land around it. Enough for a small family farm though like with the rest of the tower it’s possible to expand this. The weather’s always pleasant - the air elementals bound to moving it make sure. They’re quick to defend the tower if need be, and there are many permanent unseen servants to invisibly serve guests and do work about the place. And the elementals can push the tower at a decent pace.  You get about a dozen elder air elemental servants. If killed, they will come back in a day and a night. They can’t leave the premise, but otherwise faithfully obey you. They’re also surprisingly bright, for elementals at least. You know methods of binding more with the same properties should you require them, though it is neither a fast nor easy process. 
Moving Locations (100CP): Your tower has several dozen portals to major population centers, a few smaller towns, and an interesting hidden place of wonder or magic. It has this... for every major plane of existence in the local cosmology, and several of the minor ones. These portals form extensions of the tower on the other end, small buildings or annexes built of the towers essence.  The portals work automatically for you, and you can key other people to use them. Minions created by your power always count as ‘keyed,’ unless you’ve unkeyed them. The portals are near impossible to notice for those not keyed to them, and would require something on the level of epic magic or similar in order to force open. All of the portals are clearly marked as to where they go... but only to those that are actually keyed to using them. 
Arcane (0CP): You have traded away Life for a measure of the Arcane, writing the truth of yourself upon the fabric of Reality. It is the Wellspring of Creation, the fire from which things become Possible. It opposes destruction and stagnation. Though it’s worth noting that a nova consuming a world full of life and culture doesn’t qualify as ‘destruction’ or ‘stagnation.’ Merely change, and change is interesting.  Arcane has a kind of supremacy over mortal magics - not just normal arcane magic either. An Arcane Lich can strip a Dragon of its breath, a Beholder of its gaze, and a Sorcerer of their spells. Such work are the products of specialized Arcana, formal techniques some Liches learn. The converse is not true. An Anti-Magic field does nothing to something fueled with Arcane, while an Arcane Null-Magic Field shuts down mortal magic. An Arcane Item won’t show up to Detect Magic, won’t be damaged by Disjunction, and generally speaking ignores all such forces.  In future jumps, it’s safe to treat Arcane as a ‘higher’ force, except when it runs against other explicitly ‘higher’ reality rewriting forces, such as the Power Cosmic of Marvel or Flame Imperishable of LotR. It can affect the ‘lesser forces’, and they cannot affect it. On its own, this perk gives you a small pool of Arcane which can be used several ways
* You can fuel Sorcerae - unstructured magic where you simply create the effect you want.
* You can transfer it from or to another being or object that can hold it. This can’t be used to steal it from another being or to grant the ability to hold or use Arcane to people that cannot already do so. As its own regeneration rate is trivial, storing Arcane energy in prepared crystal and gemstone receptacles ahead of time is the normal method of getting it.
* Your creative mental energies lets you slowly dream more of it into being. Mechanically your regeneration rate is tied to your Intelligence.
* You can see Arcane Script, a magical language written in Arcane energies. It has some use in magical items. If you know the script (which you do), you can also write it, though that costs energy. It’s possible to drain the Arcane energy used to write the script, erasing what was written.
* They can develop Arcana, special disciplines fueled by their Arcane energies. Arcane naturally recovers at a snail’s pace for all but the most intelligent. More evolved liches gain bonuses to its recovery. However even for superhumanly intelligent spectral liches (the most advanced kind) the recovery rate for Arcane energy is still not terribly quick. (see notes)
 Sorcerae (0CP): You can perform Sorcerae, dreaming what you want to happen into being. This is a dangerous power, and the very power the Guild of Wizards claim was used to bring Reality into being. There are ways of sensing its use, and mortal minds were not designed to bear witness to such shapings.  There are stacking bonuses and penalties to an attempt, but how difficult it will be and how much it will cost is a shifting thing. Taking extra time makes it easier, but also makes finding you easier for those keeping an eye out for such things.
* Spending extra Arcane can reduce the difficulty.
* The easiest form of this is dreaming into being an effect you could cast - the known spells of a Sorcerer or the prepared spells of a Wizard. The known spells, that aren’t prepared, of a Wizard (and equivalents) are also pretty easy.
* Any spell you’ve seen cast, that matches a type you can cast. If you’ve cast it, you’ve seen it cast, so these bonuses often go together.
* Any other effect you’ve seen is a bit easier, but not much.
* A spell you can cast, but from an alternative source is a bit easier, but not as much. If you’re a specialist wizard, and you somehow learn a forbidden spell, or if you have Cleric levels and decide to copy a Cleric spell, you use this modifier instead
* A spell from a type you can cast, that you haven’t seen, is a little more difficult.
* A spell that isn’t appropriate (Cleric, Druid, other spell list) is more difficult.
* A spell that’s higher level then you can cast is more difficult.
* A completely new effect is even more difficult.  Such effects cost Arcana the more powerful they are, and with factors that increase difficulty. There are also some special modifiers.
* Truly destroying something, “Be Not”, involves a massive spike in cost.
* Making something real and permanent multiples the cost by ten. So if you can afford ten times the cost of Summon Monster IX, then you can permanently call such a set of helpers into being.  Groups can pool their efforts to achieve greater effects.
A Memory Of The Face Of Creation (0CP): The power of the Arcane, and the necromantic forces that bolt it to a human soul... the mind was not built to cope with such things. Well, other people's minds might not be. You deal with it fine. In fact, you’ll find that you deal with everything fine. Madness just doesn’t ‘take’ when it’s you. Your mind refuses to warp, your personality stays stable, and your view of reality matches what you sense and perceive.
* Just read the perk, its one of the best things in the CF, scaling, with unlimited potential for both magic and tech
* Limited reality warping styled magic free along with it and to fuel it
* Arcane energy was used to create the entire dnd multiverse of this setting.
 
-Enchanted Anvil (Geneforge) (300CP)
A powerful artifact which allows the crafting of enchanted equipment, so long as one has the right materials. Normally they are effectively immovable and thus bound to a specific location, this one is easily moved, as far as large heavy anvils go.


-Workshop (Generic Naruto Fanfiction) (400CP)
Going out and beating people up is not all there is to being a ninja, certainly not in the myriad worlds of Naruto fanfiction. There’s a lot of space for less… outdoorsy activities, such as seal-creation, weapons-forging, and so on. That’s where this beautiful place comes in! It’s the ultimate workshop, perfect for just about anything you may care to work at. It has a huge supply of papers and inks for your fuuinjutsu needs, herbs and plants for preparing poisons or medicines, a forge and metal supplies for smithing, timber for woodwork, and so on, for anything else you may care to work on. The quantities of the materials generated depend on their rarity and value. Something like ordinary paper and ink, or plain steel and wood, would never run out no matter how much you use, while things like paper from special, chakra-enriched trees would be in far shorter supply. But no matter how rare something might be, so long as it’s not absolutely unique, you can expect to find it here, and in sufficient quantities to work with. At the absolute slowest, for materials of priceless rarity like high quality chakra-storing gemstones or metals, you could expect a supply to regenerate bi-yearly, and proportionately lesser times for less rare substances. In future worlds this workshop updates with materials and ingredients of the respective settings, with the same replenishment rules remaining in effect.


-Wizard’s Domain (Ben 10 0.1) (400CP)
Having seen the writing on the wall or having stolen from someone who did, you have managed to isolate a small pocket of Ledgerdomain and constructed a defensible lair within it. This is a comfortable mansion with plenty of amenities, books on simple and advanced spells from this world, and conveniently generates any spell components you happen to need for your many spells and rituals. In addition, being in an isolated dimension made of magic greatly empowers your own spellcasting and makes it both easier to cast and just a bit more powerful. You may enter and leave this little pocket plane simply by thinking about it, a portal entering or leaving it appearing nearby.


-Prismatic Laboratory (Fallen London) (400CP) 
The principle of acute observation is light! And to that end, you have fashioned a workspace of lenses, liquids, critters and crystals to focus upon recreating a spectrum of lights fantastic. Ah, the impossible palette: those colors only seen in the Neath! You may not always produce something like it, but you will produce their inks and lenses in time.


-The Artful Temple That Is Not (Exalted - The Infernals) (400CP)
Unlike the many other Yozis, Oramus has no temples in the Demon City beyond the great prison-temple built atop his slumbering form. Thus, this temple cannot exist despite its meticulously artful design and wondrously magnificence the likes of which seem impossible to ever match in other architecture. 
And in truth, this is correct. For this temple exists Beyond, the place of things which are cast out and never existed at all. All around it are floating worldscapes; upside-down places, angled places, in-and-out places. Existence seems to have the quality of a cube winding in toward a central locus, and all through the air floated things unguessed and never before seen.
Here, in these alien vistas beyond perception, which are an infinite forge of the impossible that stirred the very Wyld into forms and patterns by the movement of your thoughts, you may create and think on those things deemed impossible by all. Still, caution is for the wise, for while you are protected by reality within the walls of this temple, the outside is not so kind and should you get lost behind babbling brooks of names... you might find that you never really existed at all. 
Of course, bringing this manse within Creation or Hell would defeat the very point of its construction. And so alternative measure have been devised. With but a sideways step through any doorway, the holder of the temple’s hearthstone may step within its walls, and from inside you may also open a stable portal to other realms so that others might likewise enter.


-The Sixfold Weave of Sublime Efficacy (Exalted - The Infernals) (400CP)
Quite unlike the other manses on offer here, this is not actually a singular manse. Instead, it is a network of six smaller manses arranged in an artful pattern of geomantic resonance, empowering the central manse with the essence gleaned of the other five. Each created from white brass and inlaid with black basalt, the five are formed into slender towers that channel their essence towards the center, while on their own providing little more than a luxurious abode and a minor hearthstone. 
It is the central manse that is of most note to you, though it is still build up a weaker demesne than the other manses you might acquire here, the difference is more than made up for by the creative power funneled into it by the supporting manses. A palace of white brass walls and ringed by streets of black basalt, it is a marvel to the eye built to be just as aesthetically pleasing as it is functional. Her walls are decorated with frescoes bearing differing images of the Mother of Creation and the demon princes descended from her, fortified to withstand the greatest of sieges. Her halls are lit with purest white flames that burn eternally, miniscule fragments taken from the flame that would become the Daystar’s solar flames. Her rooms are furnished with wealth to bankrupt many princes, every need and want you might have catered to by the servile intelligence of the manse itself, her only desire to aid you. Even the essence of the manse adapts to make sure you are comfortable and every small detail aligns in your favor. 
And beyond all that, you will find many, many rooms filled with magnificent workshops for every craft imaginable. Glassworking, pottery, smithing, painting, woodworking, jewelcrafting, and many more. The manse itself will aid you with any project you wish to take on within these halls, tools responding to your desires as eagerly as to your touch, and even gentle advice given on any of your handiwork if you wish for another opinion. Should you desire to, you may rearrange the flow of essence from the supporting manses to another manse than this one, but in reaction the palace shall become still, unable to help you as it wishes.


-Bleak Atelier of Necro-Engineers (Exalted - The Abyssals) (400CP)
Faith, magic and technology come together in the factory-cathedral. Within its walls were produced glorious wonders reserved for the greatest gods and Chosen. Almost none of these wondrous factory-cathedrals endure today, and those that remain are terribly damaged or lost to the impassable wilderness. But while practically no one alive could build a factory-cathedral today, the Deathlords are some of the few beings that could. Still, only one amongst the deathlords is officially known to possess an equivalent... 
And now, you may acquire one of these wonders of dark design. Built as a great tower, this imposing manse has been designed to serve both as a factory-cathedral reminiscent of those built in the First Age and as an equally effective necrosurgery laboratory using more recent designs pioneered by the Deathlords. Unlike the hallowed cathedrals built by the Solars of old, these halls have not been sanctified or constructed as a temple-manse. Instead, special precautions have been taken to ensure the cold, sterile perfection of the Abyssal Essence that powers the horrible machines within. 
Within these workshops, long forgotten First Age tools are set side by side with just as sophisticated new innovations. Here, eldritch suspension vats preserve the dead. Essence-fueled welding tools fuse bone to bone. Flasks of reagents bubble and strange devices whir, spark and glow. The place carries about it a dark majesty that scares away most natural animals and invites bad weather, yet the environment stays oddly dry and cool. Black ornaments inset with iron, onyx, and obsidian further channel the manse’s Essence into necromantic power, such that the costs of necromantic spells cast within the manse’s walls are significantly reduced. Furthermore, the manse bolsters the strength of such spells beyond the capabilities of the necromancer's own Essence. All the better to animated the necrotic warmachines one might create within.


-The Hall of the Perfect Circle (Exalted - The Solars) (400CP)
The Solar Exaltation is an engine of near perfection, split up into five parts. The castes serve to diversify the bearers of the exaltation and is brought into harmony within a perfect circle, a gathering of a single member of each of the five castes. And in honor of this most sacred harmony, this manse has been constructed. A great manor built in the style of the early first age, where perfect geometry and design met with principles of practicality and efficiency; a far cry from the ostentatious grandeur of the later years. 
But within the main hall rests five doors in perfect symmetry, each bearing the mark of a different caste emblazoned upon their face. Behind each door lies a room constructed to push the abilities of the Lawgivers to their very limits, to awaken further understanding through adversity. 
For the Bronze Tigers an ever shifting battlefield, complete with highly skilled automatons and simulated environments to push even the most skilled warriors to their very limits. 
For the Golden Bulls therein lies a temple to the Highest of Holies, a place where they can focus and realign themselves to their cause. As an additional provision this temple also contains tools and features to help train resistance, such as meditations on a bed of spikes or walking across molten orichalcum. 
For the Copper Spiders, a most wondrous forge to be theirs. Complete with all the tools required to construct some truly awe inspiring works of artifice should they possess the talent and the patience. 
For the Iron Wolves, their room contains an ever shifting puzzle building. Fixed only when the door is opened this place is designed to push stealth and infiltration techniques to the highest possible level. However one other benefit is the owner can submit the plans to a compound, real or not, and find it simulated here as a way to test their skills through places of their own devising. 
And finally for the Quicksilver Falcons, within their portal lies the ballroom of a magnificent manor. Within here simulacrums vie and jockey for social standing, ever perceptive to the slightest misstep and always eager for the slightest loophole in an agreement. After learning to survive and thrive in this merciless atmosphere, navigating most other social events is almost no effort at all.


-Gromwood (Skulduggery Pleasant V1.05) (400CP)
This house on a hill, large enough to be considered a manor, has come into your possession, perhaps after the death of a relative. While it has many rather ominous pictures on its walls and no small amount of unused sports equipment, the houses true appeal is what lies underneath it. Thought a secret passageway, you may access an extensive labyrinth hidden below the property. This labyrinth, called the Caves of the Void, is home to a variety of monsters capable of smelling magic, which they use to hunt intruders. You of course, won’t be hunted by these beasts (unless you want to be, for whatever reason). Within this maze are veins of a special black crystal, which has been a key component used to create weapons like the Sceptre of the Ancients, capable of killing gods. And in the deepest part of the caves is the Source Fountain, a pool that turns whatever you place within it magical. The house is completely paid off, and has free running water, electricity, AC and secure internet.


-Temple of Solomon (Fate Legends: Oasis of Fantasy) (400CP)
A place that has long been abandoned or, at least, a replica of the one currently in use. The Temple of Solomon is perhaps the grandest magical workshop ever to be created, one so great that it does not even exist in the mundane world. Sealed away in imaginary number space, it is only accessible to others through highly complex and difficult magical workings, though you can enter your hidden base with nothing but a thought provided you are not blocked by some means. The temple itself is quite large, with the small dimension covering several city blocks of area and the building being the size of a large mansion. Within is almost every one of Solomon’s personal notes and research on magecraft and magic, along with a great deal of lore from other famous magicians of his time and from later on as well. The small dimension has been connected to a replica of Solomon’s created magical circuits which empower the framework the workshop sits on, serving to provide a immense magical fuel source for any project you might wish to run within this space as you can freely draw on the amount of energy the King of Magic had while alive when you are in here. Finally, death in this realm is not permanent and it is far easier to bring back those who die when it is within this place. For your purposes, this means that dying in this temple will not count as an end to your chain. You may import an existing structure into this role.
* Solomon made the entire modern magic framework that allows for magecraft in fate


-Walls Containing Madness (Dark Souls 2) (400CP)
This appears as a small castle with architecture of your choosing. The entirety of this structure’s rooms and corridors appears dedicated to the pursuit of knowledge.
         Scientific work stations with various tools and instruments appear in most rooms, chains from which to hang cages and other things hang from the ceiling, and the basement contains all manner of chests and cells where the scavenged and unwilling are stored.
         Samples from captured and dissected creatures, among other beings, will be stocked within the basement, and replicated into the future for as many experiments as required. You must of course secure such valuable organs and parts yourself the first time, however.


-The Alchemy Machine (Shivers) (400CP) 
Created by the legendary alchemist Louis Garcon, this mysterious machine combines modern science with principles passed down from ancient Egyptian times. Should you have any alchemic ability or knowledge, using this machine will not only drastically enhance the potency of anything you create, but also significantly boost the output. Careful experimentation may even let you learn to automate the alchemic process, allowing the machine to produce indefinitely if provided with supplies. Without such knowledge, though, expect significantly more experimentation before you achieve anything of note.


-Alchemical Foundry |Mythic Forge | Dust Refinery | Arcane Smelter (Endless Legend) (400CP) 
Alchemical Foundry (50CP): You gain the equipment needed to extract, process, and refine Titanium and Glassteel. It exacts about one ingot a week. 
Mythic forge (150CP): You possess the tools to gather, refine, and process Mithrite and Hyperium. Good luck finding it, much less finding some that others haven't already claimed. 
Dust Refinery (100CP): Able to infuse Dust with new life, the Refinery is the staple of Dust Enchantment. While Dust infused iron is common, it pales compared to the Dust enchantments this refinery allows. Allows for the crafting of Foci and magic rings, talismans, insignias, and tomes. 
Arcane Smelter] (100CP): A self-contained device used to extract, process, and refine Palladium and Adamantium. A must have for the smith on the go.


-Bio Lab (Buso Renkin) (400CP)
Homunculi don’t really breed, so their reproduction is instead linked to creating more of their own. What this purchase does is add a respectable sized laboratory to either your property, or the warehouse, which contains all that you need (including instructions) on how to create basic humanoid and animalistic homunculi.


-The Earth Forge (Elder Scrolls Online) (400CP)
Or rather a replica of it, attached to your warehouse or slotting into the world in the location of your choosing at the start of each jump. The Earth Forge is as much a fortress as it is a workshop, hidden far away prying eyes and located deep underground, its entrance guarded by a small fort carved out in ancient times. The Forge itself is located deep underground, only accessible by following a tunnel that can easily be used as a chokepoint to bottleneck an invading army or fortified into a near- impenetrable hall of traps and sealed dwemer-metal blast doors. It's real value however, is the smithy itself. Using flame salts (which never seem to run low), raw magma (which never seems to burn or cause heatstroke unless you physically leap into it) and a massive blast furnace (which never breaks or needs refueling) in addition to its magical nature and tools surpassing what even the Grand-Masters of Tamriel could hope to lay their hands on, the Earth Forge is quite possibly one of, if not the, greatest smith's workshops on Nirn, equaled perhaps only by the yet-undiscovered Aetherium Forge and the factories of Sotha Sil the Clockwork King. Comes with a small retinue of NPC guards to... well... guard it.


-Magical Manor (Fate Stay Night) (400CP)
An expected part of your inheritance, the old family home. This is a two story redbrick home with  lavish inner furnishings, all in a German style. The house seems to clean and take care of itself, even if a whole room is trashed beyond repair, it will be in pristine condition by morning. As comfortable as the house it is, its real draw is actually the basement hidden beneath the home. Completely undetectable without significant supernatural powers or actually blowing open the ground, this basement holds an extensive magical workshop. Filled with common and rare magical reagents and ingredients, both of which replenish over time. Numerous magical tools for crafting, enchantment and a variety of other disciplines can also be found here, as well as a fair sized but empty room for summoning. Magic cast here is undetectable to those outside the basement, though the basement itself is not indestructible in any way. If you blow the place up, people will notice.


-Working Unlimited Guns (Fate Grand Order) (400CP)
A complete gun smithing set made out of a strange black metal. There are tools here for every process of creation, from shaping the metal to the fine details of the gun itself. What makes this set special is several qualities. Firstly, any gun it creates will count as a magical creation and the user is able to copy spells or magic that they can use into the gun to transfer those effects onto the weapon itself, though how they manifest may change depending on the gun type. The forge is also able to easily convert other weapons or objects into guns of similar size, retaining all their normal properties but in firearm form.


-Progressive Estate (Fate Legends: Strange New World) (400CP)
No man of science is complete without his laboratory of choice and neither can a proper magus be found without a workshop to house his life’s work. It’s much more rare that both are found in the same place however. This rather luxurious, lush and expansive estate you now own, with a few hundred acres of land and very sizeable manor house, is really just the window dressing. Attached to that fancy house up there is a combined laboratory/mansion the size of the very mansion it is attached to. Filled with technology and academic research at the very cutting edge of the 20th century, and somehow a few steps further in some cases, on three different fields of technology as well as a wide range of magecraft tools, research and notes on three magical topics of choice that would be well regarded even in the upper echelons of the Mages’ Association. While each side is already quite impressive, it is the small library regarding the efforts of the previous owner of the home to find applications towards mixing each side that is the hidden gold here. Notes on how to truly bring out the potential of technology with magecraft and vice versa are here. As well as all this, the entire estate, manor and laboratory are surrounded with multiple layers of defense and obfuscation of both technological and magical means. A small army could not break in, even if they could find the place. You may import a property into this.


-Arcanatarium (Twokinds) (400CP)
A trained mage can throw out spells on the fly, but the really impressive magic is prepared far in advance. For that, you’ll need a place to work. This workshop is fully outfitted to support a practiced mage in all their pursuits. There’s a permanent magic circle to focus your energies, a table of alchemical equipment for the brewing of potions, a well-stocked library full of tomes and scrolls of arcane knowledge, and any other dedicated workspace you’ll need for working magic. This workshop also comes stocked with plenty of ingredients and materials for your alchemicy and artifact crafting, including rarer materials like precious metals and gems. You’ll still need to provide any extremely rare or unique items, but this personalized workspace will have anything else you need for your own arcane pursuits. This property can take any form you wish, from a traditional tower to a basement laboratory. Post-jump, this workshop can be imported and attached to any property you own


-Sewing Room (Twokinds) (400CP)
Just as a cook needs a kitchen and a mage needs a laboratory, a seamstress needs a sewing room! This cozy space contains every tool you’ll need to craft beautiful garments and functional clothing. This workshop also comes with a wide variety of fabrics, fasteners, and other supplies you’ll need to complete your crafts. Even rare and exotic materials, like drake leather and wyvernsilk, are included in your stockpile.


-Altar of Spellmaking (Morroblivion) (400CP)
Your own personal altar of spellmaking. Allows you to make spells. With Spellmaker increases efficiency of the process and quality of spells made.


-Miskatonic University(Smash Up-Obligatory Cthulhu Supplement) (400CP)
Home of the Fighting Cephalopods, this college campus has an unusually soothing atmosphere, a well-stocked library, and most curiously, everyone studying here benefits from any memory, training/learning booster or uncapper perks you personally possess.


-Portable Geneforge Components (Geneforge) (500CP)
This is most of what is needed to build a Geneforge of your own. However it is also very small in comparison to a full geneforge, using this you might be able to create a full geneforge that fits in the back of a wagon. Though it lacks the required information for how to get it to truly shape others, but you could find or produce most of that on your own.


-Dwarven Forge (MCU vol.2) (500CP)
There is a place called Nidavellir. A place that has contained a dying neutron star, it was known for creating some of the most powerful weapons to exist in all of the Nine Realms. Forges were heated eternally from the heat of this star, strong enough to kill even the greatest of Asgardians were it not for one of the weapons forged in this very place. The mythical Uru springs from this place, metal that is used in the weapons of the gods. Such a place would cause untold prosperity or ruin depending on who held this place. Mayhaps the dwarves who controlled such a place realized the dangers of only having one, so there is a second structure that has been hidden away in the event Nidavellir was attacked. Maybe call it Myrkheim? Regardless, the heart of a dying star is yours to use in these mythical forges. Great works shall be created in these halls. Terrible, but great. Just don’t get in the way of the focusing lens. It could kill you.


-Flying Island Facility (In Another World With My Smartphone) (600CP)
Taking a page out of the book of Regina Babylon you made (or perhaps discovered if you’re not a techno-magical genius yourself) your own flying island with its own buildings and facilities built on top of it. The island is heavily magically warded and protected and you don’t need to worry about people on the ground noticing it, and there is a teleport pad that can take you down to the surface. You can teleport back, alongside anyone you give permission, to the island from any place in the world you’re currently in. Your island comes with its own gynoid that oversees it and makes sure it’s operating smoothly. They’re quirky but friendly and completely loyal to you. This flying island can mimic any of the ones that Regina Babylon herself made or, for 600 CP total (300 discounted) you can have a completed island with all 9 facilities once again combined together, alongside nine gynoids to look after it. If the facilities or gynoids are destroyed they’ll show up a week later good as new. The gynoids aren’t companions unless you import them as such later on. Alternatively, there is an option in the Companion section that has them start as companions, which you can read the details of in that section.


-Gushimera Laboratory (God Catching Alchemy Meister) (600CP)
This research facility used to belong to powerful mages before they were overrun by demons. Some of the knowledge was lost as the demons made their home there, but after a while they just went away and this precious fountain of knowledge came into your hands. The facility was geared towards the creation of golems, artificial Mana Spirits and even has notes about creating homunculus. It’s still somewhat operational and full of information waiting to be discovered. It will become a warehouse attachment post-jump.


-Wizard's Tower (Fate Legends: Garden of Avalon) (600CP)
Avalon is the land of the fairies, an almost unreachable realm that has only seen a handful of human, partially or fully, visitors in all of time. Within Avalon, there can be found smaller realms, such as the one that Merlin will eventually come to be imprisoned within. The realm you find yourself with access to is similar to that realm but does not imprison you. This place, a small dimension measuring a few miles across, is filled with a field of gorgeous flowers. In the centre of the dimension is a tall wizard’s tower. There are many rooms, workshops and laboratories within this tower, filled with extremely rare materials, resources, reagents and magical curios, as well as a fair few creature comforts and luxuries. Many of these resources will replenish in time too. There are even a great deal of books written on various magical subjects, some by Merlin himself and some by those much older than even him. You may enter this realm with just a thought, through all but the most powerful and thorough of preventions against dimensional travel, and exit out into any location without those most powerful protections. While others can potentially invade your dimension should they find out about it, the tower realm has protections against invasion on a similar level to the sheath Avalon does when activated.


-Cosmic Anvil (Alllstar Superman) (600CP)
 A gift from New Olympus delivered straight to your doorstep, Jumper!
This anvil and hammer are capable of smashing atoms together to form miniature suns, and with a bit of work, even miniature planets. Potentially, you could make them even bigger, or even ‘life-sized’...though this will take weeks or even months of work and it’s recommended to do so somewhere within space.


-Khorne’s Anvil (Warhammer Fantasy: Warriors of Chaos) (600CP)
This massive anvil is a one of a kind gift from the Master of Murder, completely engraved with the markings of Khorne. It will seem like it is otherwise unassuming until you begin creating weapons on it. Weapons that are hammered into shape in this anvil will be of masterwork quality regardless of the metals used, and they are eternally sharp and will never wear and tear. But this is not the greatest gift of the anvil. Khorne is willing to use the souls of magic users who are sacrificed on the anvil to grant a weapon a magic effect that reflects the magical “strength” of the mage that was sacrificed on it...with no limits. This may seem hypocritical for Khorne, but Khorne believes that magic weapons made from a subjugated mage is perhaps the greatest example of might over magic, and the weapon’s existence confirms his ideals.


-Star Forge (Marvel Magic) (600CP)
​Great Mjolnir, the hammer of Thor, was forged using the heart of a dying star, cut from the place it hanged in space by Allfather Odin himself and placed within an enchanted forge. This forge and the mold for Mjolnir was stolen and used by Loki to make a legion of brother hammers to Mjolnir during the final Ragnarok. This mould and the lesser hammers were - or perhaps will be - destroyed by Thor and channeled into an attack. But now you have come into possession of something similar. This forge, which takes the form of a special room connected to your warehouse, contains within it the heart of a dying star. This is, of course, a powerful tool, but most beings would be unable to use it directly without suffering near instant death. You are not most beings and I have the utmost confidence that you will think of something.


-The Dragons Cradle (Exalted - The Dragonbloods) (600CP)
In areas where there are powerful intersections of the essence of creation, places of magical potency can be found. The concentration of essence twists and warps the surrounding area into a Demense. However cunning architects and sorcerers can tap into this power, and construct structures on these ley lines to harness the power towards their own ends. These structures are known as Manses, and they are valuable resources to those that hold them. Thanks to the approval of your benefactor, we have been authorized to construct a place of power which can be attached to your warehouse, whatever that is. 
This manse will take the form of a luscious two story manor, with the in­ depth specifications up to you, with its elemental affinity matching yours. However what we can guarantee is a fully stocked library where you will likely find all manner of useful tomes, one of the most advanced workshops we can create to ensure you have somewhere to ply your crafts, a full set of bound servants to maintain the property, and a considerable allotment space. From the inherent power present in the manse you will find it much easier to grasp the secrets of essence, as it is a font of gaian magics; as well as any children you may have here bearing the dragon's blood will find it far more likely to exalt in the future, thanks to the potent elemental essence empowering all of its residents. 
Oh and one final feature we should add, is that it also generates a Hearthstone. This jewel, roughly the size of a chicken's egg, can either aid in your ability to recover essence through proximity or be used to power any magitech you may possess. Should you take it into the world and plant it in the ground, within one hour your manse will sprout from the ground fully formed. Although while you can retrieve the hearthstone afterwards be aware this can only be done once every ten years.


-The Underhaus (Exalted - The Abyssals) (600CP)
Your very own Underworld. Or at least, a slice of Underworld for yourself. For 200 cp, this adds an Underworld layer to your cosmic warehouse, taking on the appearance of a dark reflection of your existing warehouse, seen through the lens of death. Located "below" your warehouse in the same way that the greater Underworld is below the living world of Creation, you may designate parts of your warehouse to be small, enduring shadowlands to access this Underhaus more easily. Here you may respire necrotic essence, interact with ghosts and immaterial spirits, and store things that cannot bear the light of the sun. 
        Alternatively, if that isn’t enough, you may pay a full 600 cp and get something much more expansive. Instead of merely receiving a dark mirror of your warehouse, each of the various attachments, properties, and lands that follow you will have underworld reflections of their own. These properties shall sit as anchors within the world and each of your properties, in whole or in part, may be made into shadowlands to lead down into this greater Underhaus. Connecting all of these disjointed underworld landmarks will be an underworld appropriate to the world they stand in, a dark world that gains solidity and detail from the memories of the dead. Where none have lived or died, the terrain is grey and nearly featureless phantasms. But where many people have lived their lives and breathed their last, this underworld is filled with dark reflections and remnants of what has been lost. Primeval forests that have since been cut down and burnt for farmland, the remnants of cities lost to war and villages lost to plague, and whatever else has been lost to the sands of time in the world you find yourself in. The population of this underworld, aside from any followers you bring with you, would be composed merely of plasmic creatures and echoes of the dead, not true ghosts of the natives. However, once established below a world, the dead of that place may choose to resist the call of whatever fate would normally remain for them past death, to linger within the Underhaus as ghosts.
* Gives all the workshops and lands a underworld layer to craft with plus some other stuff


-Goblin Forge (Hellboy) (600CP)
A replica of the forge used by the nameless goblin smith who forged the Golden Army. The forge is magical, and can do much of the work in the forging process by itself, only needing your input for the first designs before becoming capable of churning out an army- or the weapons to equip them- in a much shorter amount of time than would be thought possible. The items forged by it are all but indestructible, and will last for millenniums without needing repair or upkeep. It will be up to you to provide any resources needed for their crafting, however, but any enchantments you choose to apply will be applied evenly to every craft you wish it to be, so long as you can supply it in the creation of the first one. Can become a Warehouse attachment Post-Jump.


-Lab Space(Asterix the Gaul) (600CP)
​Be a Roman engineer or a Gaulish druid, both need a space that’s completely theirs, so that they can work in peace. This is the one for you. Filled with the absolute latest in instruments and tools, and with a truly staggering variety of parts and materials, it’s basically the perfect workshop. You even find your mind working sharper here, allowing you to innovate at a slightly increased speed than normal. In every following jump, this updates with the absolute cutting edge of all the tools, materials and substances required for the pursuit of both science and magic, enough for you to come up with true wonders no matter where you end up. Again, this doesn’t stock one of a kind materials that you would normally require a month long quest to get. Rather, if it’s available in a shop anywhere in the world, a mortal shop, you will find it here


-At The End of Time (Divinity - Original Sin) (600CP)
​The​ ​Sanctuary​ ​was​ ​once​ ​home​ ​to​ ​the​ ​pair​ ​of​ ​god-blessed humans​ ​who​ ​were​ ​appointed​ ​guardians​ ​over​ ​the​ ​box​ ​that​ ​kept​ ​darkness​ ​from​ ​this​ ​world.​ ​With​ ​no interference,​ ​they​ ​will​ ​soon​ ​rediscover​ ​it​ ​and​ ​slowly​ ​begin​ ​gaining​ ​access​ ​to​ ​the​ ​variety​ ​of​ ​rooms it​ ​houses.​ ​But​ ​due​ ​to​ ​a​ ​wrinkle​ ​in​ ​time,​ ​space,​ ​or​ ​perhaps​ ​simply​ ​in​ ​response​ ​to​ ​your​ ​own​ ​special nature,​ ​a​ ​copy​ ​of​ ​that​ ​magical​ ​space​ ​seems​ ​to​ ​have​ ​sprung​ ​into​ ​existence.​ ​Not​ ​a​ ​perfect​ ​copy with​ ​bound​ ​elementals​ ​and​ ​a​ ​Tapestry​ ​of​ ​Time,​ ​mind,​ ​but​ ​similar​ ​enough​ ​to​ ​service​ ​as​ ​a​ ​fine base​ ​in​ ​the​ ​space​ ​between​ ​worlds. The​ ​Second​ ​Sanctuary​ ​can​ ​be​ ​accessed​ ​through​ ​a​ ​small​ ​magical​ ​emerald​ ​in​ ​the​ ​shape of​ ​a​ ​pyramid.​ ​Tapping​ ​it​ ​will​ ​teleport​ ​you​ ​directly​ ​to​ ​the​ ​dining​ ​hall.​ ​Tapping​ ​it​ ​once​ ​inside​ ​will teleport​ ​you​ ​back​ ​to​ ​exactly​ ​where​ ​you​ ​were​ ​when​ ​you​ ​came​ ​in. 
The​ ​Second​ ​Sanctuary​ ​will​ ​be​ ​surrounded​ ​on​ ​all​ ​sides​ ​by​ ​empty​ ​space,​ ​with​ ​stars sprinkling​ ​the​ ​blackness​ ​off​ ​in​ ​the​ ​far​ ​distance.​ ​This​ ​is​ ​merely​ ​an​ ​illusion​ ​as​ ​the​ ​rooms​ ​occupy​ ​a pocket​ ​dimension​ ​and​ ​are​ ​not​ ​actually​ ​situated​ ​in​ ​outer​ ​space.​ ​If​ ​you​ ​desire,​ ​you​ ​can​ ​set​ ​the view​ ​to​ ​that​ ​of​ ​appearing​ ​to​ ​float​ ​amidst​ ​a​ ​certain​ ​solar​ ​system​ ​you​ ​have​ ​already​ ​encountered. It​ ​contains​ ​two​ ​plush​ ​bedrooms,​ ​each​ ​with​ ​a​ ​queen-sized​ ​four-post​ ​bed,​ ​desk,​ ​a​ ​chair, several​ ​chests,​ ​and​ ​a​ ​wardrobe,​ ​everything​ ​crafted​ ​from​ ​wood​ ​and​ ​comfortable​ ​red​ ​fabrics.​ ​In addition​ ​there​ ​is​ ​a​ ​small​ ​dining​ ​hall​ ​set​ ​off​ ​to​ ​one​ ​side​ ​in​ ​the​ ​midst​ ​of​ ​a​ ​well-tended​ ​garden.​ ​The table​ ​will​ ​feed​ ​anyone​ ​who​ ​sits​ ​down​ ​at​ ​it​ ​with​ ​simple,​ ​but​ ​filling,​ ​food​ ​and​ ​drink.​ ​
The​ ​Second Sanctuary​ ​also​ ​comes​ ​equipped​ ​with​ ​a​ ​large,​ ​but​ ​currently​ ​empty,​ ​library​ ​and​ ​a​ ​workshop​ ​that includes​ ​a​ ​classic​ ​forge,​ ​tools​ ​and​ ​all. Don’t​ ​be​ ​surprised​ ​to​ ​if​ ​you​ ​find​ ​a​ ​tall​ ​Elf​ ​wandering​ ​the​ ​library​ ​or​ ​relaxing​ ​at​ ​the​ ​feasting table.​ ​He​ ​dresses​ ​as​ ​loudly​ ​as​ ​a​ ​rainbow​ ​on​ ​several​ ​kinds​ ​of​ ​narcotics​ ​and​ ​is​ ​a​ ​little​ ​too​ ​friendly when​ ​it​ ​comes​ ​to​ ​invading​ ​personal​ ​space,​ ​but​ ​he’s​ ​worth​ ​listening​ ​to.​ ​When​ ​he​ ​does​ ​stop​ ​by, his​ ​pockets,​ ​packs,​ ​and​ ​spaceship​ ​(How​ ​do​ ​you​ ​think​ ​he​ ​got​ ​here?​ ​Flapping​ ​his​ ​arms?)​ ​will​ ​be simply​ ​packed​ ​to​ ​the​ ​gills​ ​with​ ​magical​ ​weapons,​ ​enchanted​ ​armor,​ ​mysterious​ ​trinkets,​ ​and mystic​ ​essences​ ​brought​ ​with​ ​him​ ​from​ ​Rivellon​ ​proper.​ ​His​ ​stock​ ​tends​ ​to​ ​very​ ​wildly​ ​with​ ​each visit,​ ​but​ ​he’ll​ ​usually​ ​have​ ​at​ ​least​ ​a​ ​few​ ​eye-catching​ ​artifacts.​ ​Who​ ​know​ ​what​ ​he​ ​might​ ​find​ ​in his​ ​travels​ ​through​ ​the​ ​multiverse?​ ​You​ ​might​ ​be​ ​surprised​ ​just​ ​what​ ​he​ ​can​ ​get​ ​his​ ​fingers​ ​on.

-Forge and Ore(Silmarillion) (600CP)
The Dwarves are known for their crafting above all things. To craft the proper equipment takes a fine forge and proper raw materials. You now have your own forge fully equipped for forging any item of metal. Attached to the grand forge is a cave filled with much of the most common ores and even a bit of mithril. In future jumps ores of materials in that setting will begin to appear deeper in the cave. The rarer the metal the less of it there will be. The forge and cave may be attached to your warehouse or another property you own.


-Enchanter’s Forge (Nexus) (600CP)
A rare thing in Nexus, the Enchanter’s Forges are the result of a magical catastrophe well before recorded history, considered myths by most people to this day. An Enchanter’s Forge is actually a chaotic collection of magics and Mist in a small pocket dimension that will bind itself to an individual that claims it. The power held within this collection of magics is potent and may be worked as if it were a material substance, though it must be anchored to a physical medium to be of actual use, effectively tying the resulting magics to an object. This creates an enchantment that can potentially carry a wide variety of effects. 
Working the magic within an Enchanter’s Forge is exceptionally difficult, requiring a lifetime of work to master the process and gain the potential to create truly powerful enchantments. Until then, you can only really give minor ones such as an enchantment for a blade to drink in blood to repair itself or creating a bow that produces its own arrows. Actually making enchantments with the Enchanter’s Forge takes a great deal of time, requiring a heavy investment in time to actually create any powerful enchantments. Even then, you must experiment and practice with it to garner any results, no two Enchanter’s Forges are the same, meaning you cannot rely on the experiences of others to guide your own use. The power within an Enchanter’s Forge never seems to run out, and it is a great source of magical power if you possess some other way to utilize it


-Caern (World of Darkness - Werewolf the Apocalypse) (600CP)
A caern is a natural upwelling of spiritual energy. Werewolves and fera treasure and protect them as holy sites and places to renew their spiritual ties and gather for various rituals. Unlike normal caerns that can be exhausted or fade without ritual support, yours will never fade and has a regenerating supply of spiritual energy and magic. You may freely allow or bar people from using the energy the caern provides to refill their gnosis pool. Normally the garou nation would make a rather large stink about a couple of low rank werewolves owning a caern, but the property it sits on is legally yours via inheritance, hook or crook, or outright buying it from some human that didn’t know any better. Drop Ins that purchase this find a deed in their warehouse. It comes with ten acres of forest, but you may import another property to get the benefits. For an extra 100 points the forest increases to 100 acres, becomes tax free, and becomes immune to attempts to buy it or steal it via shenanigans legal shenanigans.


-First Nome (Kane Chronicles) (600CP)
The First Nome in Egypt is the oldest and most impressive in the entire House of Life. It has the most extensive library, the largest collection of artifacts, the most members, and the most overall resources. It also hosts the Hall of Ages and the (currently empty) throne of the pharaoh. Now you can bring it with you, importing it into each new setting. As a bonus, the Nome’s membership will include magicians from past and future worlds you’ve visited, its library will include books of other magic systems, and its vaults will include artifacts from the same. The Hall of Ages will detail the history of whatever world it is currently in, with side corridors providing less detailed accounts of former worlds.


-Rogue Nome (Kane Chronicles) (600CP)
Apparently you weren’t alone when you broke with the House of Life. You brought two or so a dozen friends with you, all nearly as skilled in Egyptian magic as you are. You collectively occupy a mansion that is either magically hidden from mortals or situated in the Duat - the difference can be negligible at times. It is defended by powerful spells, well supplied in terms of both mundane and magical resources, and has a library filled with scrolls and books on magic and the gods. The magicians here do not count as companions, and the Nome can either be imported into later settings or made into a warehouse attachment.


-Magic Research Facility (Death mage doesn’t want a fourth time) (600CP)
Magic and science. Alone they are great, together and in the right hands they are all powerful. The sleekness of a laboratory at the cutting edge of science, housing the greatest tools, magical and otherwise. A great thing that has come into your possession. Either inserted somewhere in the world itself, lodged away in your warehouse, or attached to some property you already having following you around, is a high-tech facility on par with, or perhaps slightly above, that which the eponymous Vandalieu had been trapped and tortured within during his time in Origin. Its tools are specially made to analyze and interact with magic, and as such it is the perfect home for magical experiments of all kinds. Whether it be dissecting or containing monsters, trying out brand new spells, or even processing and mass producing magical materials and even magic items, this facility is perfectly made for all of it. Of possibly greatest use to those with great stores of magic is the spell testing room, however, as this room is perfectly suited for testing out and analyzing even the most powerful of spells, localizing its effects and preventing even the most powerful of them from affecting anything outside of them.

Mundane Small Scale Supplies
Items that are not supernatural, but on a personal level, examples would include a small box of supplies.




-Priority Arrangements (Doom 3) (50CP) 
A certain amount of… discreetness is required when working with materials as sensitive as those common in your line of work. While high-end tech components or raw materials are easily acquired and delivered, materials such as holy relics or certified virgin’s blood are rather less so. Although taking such items through customs and security is normally a fairly sizable challenge, you do have an advantage - these forms. Suitable for ordering items or attaching to crates or other ‘deliverables’, these certificates ensure that nothing but the most determined intent will ever cause them to be searched during routine checks. You’ll not need to worry about delays or unpleasant questions, though you might want to avoid using them to, for example, mail explosives to the UAC’s board of directors. Even authoritative paperwork filled out in triplicate only holds so much power, after all. In future jumps, these forms will automatically adjust to whatever other packages you need to get to their destination without any poking and prodding.


-Stockpiles (Girl's front line) (50CP)
We can’t let you set off empty-handed; here’s 5000 Ammo, Parts, Rations, and Manpower to get your army started (it takes 30 of each to make a baseline T-Doll, while the most consistently powerful Dolls cost something like 600/400/100/600 for a reliable chance of getting them). Each purchase gets you another 5k.
* This is not just normal ammo, parts, rations and manpower, you can combine them to make T dolls which are AI-piloted android fire platforms for military operations.


-Electronics (Star Wars KotOR) (50CP)
A large supply of computer spikes and repair parts that can be used with nearly any modern machine in the galaxy. Computer spikes overwhelm electronics with junk data and are used by hackers to aid them in bypassing electronic security doors and terminals. Repair parts are packages of universally adaptable components that can be used to fix or upgrade droids, vehicles, and other machines.




-Scrap Pile (9 Jumpchain) (50CP)
A humongous pile of junk. It never seems to run out of materials and possesses an uncanny amount of bits useful to your current project.


-Memory Crystal (Five Star Stories) (100CP) 
A backup memory crystal, strong enough that it could easily be used to instantly record live combat information to be replayed later. It could also be used for other mundane purposes, such as serving as the hard drive for multiple supercomputers.


-Some Really Good String (Claymore) (100CP) 
You have a sizable supply of some really good string, if you were to cut someone’s torso open and then reattach their torso with this string, somehow their core muscles would still function regardless of if the wound heals. They would also be able to perform incredible acrobatic feats as though there was nothing wrong regardless of how extreme their movements. As well even if they had their guts ripped open by a monster thrusting their arm all the way through the string itself would remain undamaged, and not even require any attention. Skill at stitching flesh back together not required, or even mildly important, just shove it through and so long as it holds the wound together they’ll be good to go.




-Inexhaustible QE Comm Link (Eclipse Phase) (100CP)
Two fingernail-sized Quantum Entanglement communication arrays. If each is installed in a separate device, those two devices can communicate instantaneously no matter the distance. Unlike standard QE comms in the setting, the qubits are not expended when information is transmitted. It has the bandwidth of a high-speed fibre optic connection.


-Material Limitations (World Seed) (100CP)
Even with the advanced technology commonplace on Earth nowadays, material limitations haven’t changed. Or rather, you could say that they’ve gotten even worse. After all, how are you going to store antimatter if you have only steel at hand? Luckily, you won’t ever have problems finding the materials you need. Whether you’ll stumble upon them while searching through a scrapyard, or find just the right people who can get you that obscure alloy you need, nothing will stop you from building whatever you want besides your own skill. Well, if you’re keeping it reasonable, at least. 
The chance of you finding what you’re searching for decreases exponentially with the material’s “strength” and rarity, and increases by how much you know about said material, scientifically, and how good your technology skills are. So while a regular schmuck would probably never find Adamantium, someone who could reproduce it themselves in only a few years would have much, much better chances. So if you’re in a situation where it is impossible to get what you want with what you know and where you are right now? Then you’ll have to get to work yourself. Good riddance then that you can eventually reproduce any material or alloy that you have seen, though for extremely advanced ones it might take an unreasonable amount of time and skill. 




-Nanomaterials Body (Arpeggio of Blue Steel) (100CP)
First free Mental Model, no discount Mental Models use nanomaterials to form a physical body around their Union Core to match their subconscious appearance. All Mental Models have a nanomaterials body surrounding their Union Core for free. You can purchase spare nanomaterials bodies to house any other AIs you might have. For Nanomaterials properties, see the Notes section.


-Nanomaterials Sieve (Arpeggio of Blue Steel) (100CP)
This sand sieve can be used to filter nanomaterials from seawater and sand. Even in settings where the seawater doesn’t have any nanomaterial particles from damaged Fog ships, it somehow produces about a pound of nanomaterials each time its scooped through the ocean and sand.


-Thanatonium Supply (Arpeggio of Blue Steel) (100CP)
A material used in corrosive torpedos and other Fog weaponry, this highly unstable matter is used along with nanomaterials to create some of the exotic effects that the Fog’s technology is known for, such as graviton engines, and the various gravity and space-altering superweapons. This is a small stockpile, enough to fully re-arm a Fog vessel with corrosive torpedos. The stockpile replenishes monthly in your warehouse. 


-Honkai Cubes (Honkai Impact Third) (100CP)
You have a supply of Honkai Cubes and know how to make more. Crystallized Honkai energy that when used to make or enhance weapons, gear, or anything really far enhances it beyond normal limits of human capabilities. Of course just having them does nothing, and if you just slap it on a low quality weapon it wont go very far. But with proper application of skill and infusion you can use these to create incredible things. Just beware potential feedback. Not intended to be fed to Tunas.


-Common Material Cache|Rare Material Cache|Lightsaber Crystals (Star Wars The Old Republic) (125CP)
Common Material Cache (25CP) This cache contains common 'mundane' crafting materials, such as durasteel, synthweave, armorplast, and tibana gas. Each cache contains sufficient material to fully outfit 4 people, with enough left over to keep the gear repaired between refills. Includes blueprints for turning your materials into these common materials, plus blueprints for all other items you purchase with CP. The material is replaced yearly.
Rare Material Cache (50CP) It's unlikely to be useful anywhere else, but just in case, this cache contains 10 kilograms each of several Lightsaber-resistant materials: beskar, phrik, ultrachrome, and refined cortosis. The metals are ready for use in crafting or modifying equipment. The cache also includes a modest quantity of other exotic materials, such as precious gemstones, technologically useful non-Force-imbued crystals, and organic materials like krayt dragon hide. The material is replaced yearly.
Lightsaber Crystals (50CP) If you want to create more Lightsabers without access to the setting's unique metaphysical geology, you'll need these. Each fist-sized rock has a sample of Force-sensitive crystal growing from its surface, which can easily be broken off into chunks sized for lightsaber crafting or creating Force Focuses. Purchase includes a rock for every type and color of crystal available in the setting, including synthetic crystals such as the red Force-crystals favored by the Sith. The crystals are always properly attuned to whoever harvests them, regardless of color, and will regrow within a day.


-Ecto-Ranium (Danny Phantom) (200CP) 
​Ecto-ranium, the rare and mythical ore that is basically the kryptonite to ghosts. They can not touch it and start to lose their powers when near it. It can be turned into weapons or items. You get a ten pound supply that regenerates monthly. ​In future jumps this ore will work on incorporeal spirits as if they were solid beings. So you can line your house to keep ghosts out.


-Spare parts(Generic factory) (200CP) 
You will get a large crate marked “Spares” that will spawn replacement parts whenever something you own or are responsible for maintaining needs replacement parts. The spares will always be of the same quality as the originals. If the crate is destroyed or stolen, it will re-appear whole in your cosmic warehouse the next day.


-A big hunk of Jade (Kindred of the East) (200CP) 
Like seriously, it’s huge. Size of an average watermelon. You get another one every year, too. It’s probably worth a fortune, even outside of Shen circles. Your choice of color, which matters for some purposes.
* Useful for ton of cultivation enchantments and formations


-Taydenite (Ben 10) (200CP)
You have found yourself in posession of a large taydenite crystal. Both the rarest and hardest gem in the galaxy, it could be sold for a small fortune. The only thing known to be able to cut taydenite is taydenite. Taydenite is also used to power spaceships, so with some work you could use it as a power source.




-Build-A-Minion Kit (Lego Dimensions) (200CP)
A nice set of parts for building your very own robotic henchman. They are guaranteed to be absolutely loyal to you, with the ability to appear automatically at your side when you call for them. Though they are sapient, they won’t count as a Companion unless you Import them into another setting. They also come with one 100 CP Power from the above list.


-Decals (Modded Fallout) (200CP)
From hot rod flame prints to the ominous black coatings of the Enclave’s Hellfire troops and Pew-Pew’s Sunset Sarsaparilla look to your dog’s pirate bandana, looking the part is all part of the game. This collection of paint sprays, decorative doodads, engravers and other miscellaneous tools gives you everything you need to make quick and easy yet nonetheless remarkably useful cosmetic changes to your equipment. 
But more than that - these supplies seem to always make your items just that little bit more… more. After all, a custom-made handcannon should be preferable over some standard factory-made model, right? Each modification you make to your items will provide a minor but beneficial effect, such as a lime-green paint job making you more resistant against radiation than you normally would be, and the classic ‘red cross’ associated with army medics might likewise bolster your first aid and surgical skills. The effects tend to be fairly modest at best, but these supplies are compatible with just about any kind of item you’d like to use - even those from worlds wholly unlike Fallout.




-"Iconic Equipment!" (My Hero Academia) (200CP)
Not all heroes need it, but many use the equipment granted to them by the support industry to complement their skills and Quirks and make them a better hero. Precision made custom firearms, specialized braces that reduce the stress of physical Quirks and close combat, sturdy synthetic ribbons to bind enemies even during combat, specialized armor pieces and more. You have up to three individual pieces of equipment that serves the purpose of emphasizing your strengths or downplaying your weaknesses. Keep in mind that it won’t really be stuff that stands up on its own merits, but elevates what you can currently do.


-Robot Deployment (Arknights) (200CP)
 Sending people into the heat of battle is always a risky proposition. Even if the battle is won, the loss of an ally will always weigh heavily the further you go. However, that is not something that has to happen. You have the ability to drop in up to five robot operators as a way to support you and your allies. While they might not be up to par against most operators, they offer various tactical advantages, and even if they are destroyed, they will respawn in your base/Workshop after a day. Sacrificing them for the sake of victory surely would weigh less on you, at least if you still see sacrifices as something to avoid.


-The Midas Touch (Highschool DxD) (200CP)
You know what plebeians or Neophytes have to struggle for? Money. You know what gets mortals to move mountains and makes your summer trip for you and your friends amazing? Money. You know things you have trouble with? Money isn’t one of those things. While you may be rolling in dosh already from your family’s holdings or your own hard-earned cash, you are an amazingly competent businessman (or woman) who can quickly turn a dime into 10k with some time and investment, able to quickly secure a large amount of legal income for yourself with little effort. Of course, illegal activities or certain supernatural powers can make those dividends increase tenfold or more...just try not to get caught.


-Treasury (Generic Naruto Fanfiction) (200CP)
Oh, what’s this? It seems you grabbed all the money in the treasury before you left! Or someone grabbed it for you and sent it to you! Anyway, you have at your disposal a huge amount of money, easily equal to a significant percentage of the total amount the most powerful nation here had in their treasury! 
The exact amount can change, but it’s always more than enough for you to live a life of absolute, ridiculous luxury. You can pay off entire armies hunting for you if you want, or buy islands or even small countries with this. It’s ridiculous. In future jumps this treasury adapts, becoming whatever currency is used there, or multiple currencies if that’s what you want. Whatever happens, this is always enough to place you solidly among the very absolute richest people in the world. 
All this money is always entirely untraceable, allowing you to withdraw it in any number of ways. In worlds that allow it it gives you a secret bank account, or accounts as the case may be, that you can move money in and out of at will, whether by cheques and cards that are also provided, or just piles or cash or precious metals just appearing and/or disappearing in front of you or in your pocket. Any money in here can be withdrawn 1:1 in any currency you want, however exotic. This amount of money is generated anew at the beginning of each jump, or at the end of every decade in jumps that last longer than 10 years.




-Ore Chest (God Catching Alchemy Meister) (200CP)
A magical chest full of different ores, rare metals and even some gems, around a kilogram of each, for a total of 20 kilograms at maximum produced. It replenishes the contents each day at midnight. Making it a stable, if small, source of income. You can put another kilogram of any ore, metal or the likes in there so the chest will also produce it in the future. This could be handy if you ever want an exotic weapon.




-The Green Box (Genius the Transgression) (200CP)
A verdant steamer trunk closed with a simple lock, that can only be opened with a key you’ll find on your person, always. Filled with an assortment of random bits and doodads that would be considered rare crafting materials for your Aesthetic as well as dozens of other things that could be used to craft Wonders of other Aesthetics, in general it has a massive amount of parts that range from small computer chips to diesel truck engine parts. If you need more just close the box and open it again, it’ll be full.




-Mods & Augments (Mass Effect Andromeda) (200CP)
 Sometimes you just need to coax a bit more performance out of your tools. And sometimes, you just need them to do something else entirely. You now have both a full collection of weapon mods and augmentations, as well as the blueprints to produce more. The mods are usable on any weapon of the matching category, even in future settings. And the augmentations are fantastic when you want to change how a gun performs. Maybe you want an assault rifle that can never run out of ammo, or a shotgun that spits lightning bolts? Or maybe you simply want to change the firing options you have available? If you can break down and build a piece of gear, you can integrate an augmentation into it. And the better skilled you are at building that item, the more augments you can put in to  it. Keep in mind that some augments have different effects if they are on a weapon versus a piece of armor.


-Screaming Rock (Project Arms) (200CP)
This unnerving rock, strangely and seemingly naturally sculpted to depict numerous hands and faces of the souls who originally found it, is an alien space rock. No, I’m not joking. Whatever native intelligence it has is either in deep sleep, is silently observing content to remaining passive or has long since vacated the substrate of the rock to somewhere else somehow. Either way you are now left you a hunk of nanomachines that are ridiculously versatile in how they be used. With research you can use this to make your own ARMs, and through using cultured samples you can effective have no real limit as to how many you make, but more easily you can use electrodes to connect more conventional computers to this mass as an interface and use it as a super-advanced supercomputer that requires some jury-rigging into making it useful and will probably require a dedicated custom OS (Operating System). It can’t be that hard, heck a 12-year-old managed it.


-Jabberwock Claw (Project Arms) (200CP)
This remnant of one of the past rampages of the Jabberwock is a uniquely dangerous item, especially to ARMs. One of the few weapons that can equalise a fight between an ARMs and a non- ARMs, this weapon, which can take the appearance of a literal, almost triangular claw or a sword hilt capable of making a blade of glowing nanomachines at your discretion, retains the Jabberwocks healing retarding function, the Anti-ARMs virus that can leave permanent injuries on an ARMs, those normally immortal and perfectly healing superhumans. Like any sword, its lethality depends on how well it’s wielded, but it is the swords property that will make sure any wounds caused will refuse to heal properly. This quality will expand to prevent proper healing in anything with abnormal healing and can deal lethal damage to being normally immortal due to fast-healing or outright regeneration.


-Nth metal ingots (Injustice) (200CP)
Now this is valuable indeed – some of the most valuable material on earth, in fact. This set of ingots, when cast into a proper form and utilized in machinery, can negate gravity, allowing for its user to fly if worn as a belt. Furthermore, it possesses extreme strength and power, making it highly suitable for use in weaponry or armor. You gain about ~1 ton of the material, which replenishes weekly if lost or destroyed (and under no other circumstances).
* Nth metal has a bunch of other crazy properties like magic negation, cronopowers etc, full list can be found here.




-Evolutionary Potential|Mysterious Time Stream Evolves You|Record of Evolution|Instinct|Blue Crystal|Green Crystal|Red Crystal|Yellow Crystal (E.V.O. Search for Eden) (800CP)
Evolutionary Potential (0CP) You now have the ability to gather and store an energy that can only be properly described as evolutionary potential or EVO for short. This will slowly accumulate as you go about the natural process of survival. Impressive acts such as surviving a natural disaster or mortal combat will grant you larger amounts, and eating food will give you some based on the relative value of it. Namely, the higher up on the food chain (meaning it processes larger amounts of biological energy) it is, the more you'll gain per pound. You do technically have a cap on how much you can store relative to your form, but it's large enough that at full capacity you could go through a large number of relatively extreme changes before bottoming out. Actually reaching that maximum is another story.
Mysterious Time Stream Evolves You (0CP) I shouldn't have to explain why the natural process of evolution isn't really going to work for you. Thankfully you get to cheat. By expending EVO you can evolve yourself, with the cost depending on the scale and complexity of the change, along with how much is diverges from the current state of yourself and nature, as adaptation is specifically influenced by its environment. It's easier to become a large reptilian beast when the dinosaurs roam the earth for example. This only requires intent on your part, with nature handling the rest. Note that evolving leaves you with a new body in it’s prime, meaning you should haven’t to worry about old age. Evolving only requires several minutes to let the changes take place. Never more then five, and should you really push yourself you might be able to manage it in two, although it's advisable to take your time with the process as the end results will be much better if done with patience.
Record of Evolution (0CP) You can effectively review your evolutionary time line, including all forms you've previously had, in a sort of mental catalog. It possesses all the information you have about the form, and you can sort through it effortlessly to find what you want. While it doesn't really have any use beyond this on it's own, further perks might just let you use these stored designs in interesting way.
Instinct (0CP) For the duration of this jump odds are you're going to be changing forms on a regular basis, and you probably aren't to be exactly familiar with them. From now on regardless of the form you take you have a full and complete set of instincts that let you control and use your form with competency. This ranges all the way from basic body control to knowing that the thing you see right there is something your body would love to eat. At all times you have a complete awareness of your instincts, as clear as a voice in your head would be, instead of them just being subconscious impulses. You're also aware of why they are telling you what they do.
Blue Crystal (200CP) About as simple as it gets, this little bugger acts as a gatherer and battery for evolutionary potential. Eating it will result in gaining a very large chunk of EVO, enough to fuel a series of large changes for you.
Green Crystal (200CP) This crystal analyzes the path evolution has taken, and when ingested will allow you at a time of your choosing to change back to a form in your Record of Evolution, a transformation which may last for up to a month. This doesn't have to be used right away, you can eat it and bank the use until a time of your choosing, and at any one time you can store roughly three such uses.
Red Crystal (200CP) Probably best described as evolutionary steroids, and the most blatant of the crystals, this one takes in evolutionary data and uses it to create a new and extremely potent evolutionary form. When ingested you can change into this form, a transformation that can last up to one month. While temporary, and despite having no control over what said form will be, this does mean that said form will be added to your Record of Evolution, which can prove very useful in conjunction with the Green Crystals or the Review of Evolution perk.
Yellow Crystal (200CP) This crystals gathers and analyzes evolutionary data. Eating it results in a sudden flood of information into your mind that will inform you of all the various useful evolutionary paths you could take, giving an awareness of options you otherwise would have been completely blind to. Alternatively you can let it rest in an environment for a few days and then devour it to gain a sudden influx of data on the local biosphere and living beings.




-Originite Prime Bundle | A2 Arts Drones (Arknights) (300CP)
Originite Prime Bundle (100CP) You gain access to several crates of pure Originium that can be utilized for various means, and will restock itself every week. Wrong handling will be dangerous, however post-Jump, this will be perfectly safe to use in any way.
A2 Arts Drones (200CP) A group of 6 semi-autonomous drones powered by Originium. They are capable of firing Arts-based beams towards a target and possess quite a great protection against arts-based attacks, however they are decently easy to destroy using physical attacks. Restocked every week.
* A common mineral in Terra, this semi-transparent black crystal contains enormous energy, and is the primary factor of causing Catastrophes. Widely used in the field of Arts, it works as the basic material and catalyst of all kinds of Arts and Arts items. Without Originium, the efficiency of Arts would, without a doubt, drop dramatically. As technologies develop, more and more countries start to use it as an energy source.


-Olaminium stock (Trinity:Aeon) (300CP) 
A stable isotope of element 114, this recently created material has replaced depleted uranium as the military's ultra-dense material of choice. Being still light enough that it can be used for construction or armor plating, Olaminium is even better than lead at blocking radiation. The sheer demand for this material makes it extremely expensive to acquire, even for the Aeon Trinity, and it is the preferred material for cutting-edge military-grade equipment. You receive about a shoebox's worth of ingots, which replenishes monthly, and the instructions on how to make more.


-Programmable Metal (Batman the Animated Series) (300CP)
A special metal that can be “programmed” with only a few slight touches, creating impressive geometric shapes, weapons, or nigh-unbreakable bindings and changing flexibility and rigidity in a moment’s notice. In addition to a small supply of the metal that you have, you also have the know how to make more.


-The Holy Grail (Iron sky) (300CP) 
Well now. This is a cup weighing 84 ounces, an endless source of the wonder chemical known as Vril. Vril is a chemical that is behind all of the Vrilian technology in this world, providing unlimited energy, immortality, regeneration and incredibly heightened physical abilities.
With a direct drink from this vessel you would be instantly cured of all ailments, and your physical strength is raised to such heights that you can kill a T-Rex with one hit. Plugged in as a power source, which is as simple as dipping wires in it, the grail provides an unlimited amount of any and all energies you might care to ask of it. Even chocolates made of it are enough to reverse decades of aging and fix any diseases plaguing the body. You also get an unlimited supply of these chocolates.


-Vat of F.E.V. (Fallout 4) (300CP)
A vat of Forced Evolutionary Virus, developed by the Pre-War government in their attempts to create super-soldiers. This vat seems to have belonged to the Institute. Those who are dipped inside transform rapidly, gaining muscle mass at the cost of losing their secondary sexual characteristics. That is, if they’re lucky; those who have been exposed to radiation tend to have things go wrong, losing their mind as they transform… or worse. Maybe you could find a way to improve on the formula?


-Stone Creatures (Ben 10) (400CP)
Eight figurines that can transform into large stone golems to fight or do physical labor for you. Any lost or destroyed figurines will reappear in your magic bag (if you have one) or in your warehouse the next day. As they are technically sapient you could therotically free them from your control. They appear to have been following you willingly, so as long as you haven’t mistreated them they will be amicable towards you. Freed stone creatures do not count as companions and must be podded if you wish to keep them.


-Done Dirt Cheap (Pokemon Sword and Shield) (400CP)
What’s a researcher to do? Good assistants and proper materials are so hard to come by these days. Well, no, not really, you might just be lazy. You can probably find them off the side of the road if you spent about five minutes. This perk helps you get quick volunteers to help look for things your research depends on; and with getting the basic materials and tools needed to do it in the first place, all on the cheap! You could pay off your helpers with stories, or even the results of your research if you don’t care to hang onto it. Also helps with getting help with various other situations with similar benefits.


-Echoes of the Time War (Ben 10.01) (400CP)
Where did you get these? Or when did you get them? This is a trio of Time Beast eggs. They are a substantial power source for time machines, able to charge them up with enough power to go as far as the creation of the universe, someplace most time travelers couldn’t hope to reach on their own. Should you instead decide to hatch them, the Time Beasts that emerge will be loyal to you and see you as their parent, being a ferocious pack that can travel up and down the timestream freely. Let’s see how smug your enemies are when you send these angry dogs after them years in the past!




-Pale Ore (Hollow Knight Voidheart) (400CP)
A highly sought after material, filled with pale energy. Pale Ore was often used in the creation of mastercrafted armor and weaponry, for the edges it can produce are ever keen and never require sharpening or maintenance, and their durability is said to outstrip that of many rare alloy metals. In addition, their cold bite can often quickly inflict frostbite on unprotected foes. You’ve managed to arrange shipments of this ore, granting you several chunks of it every week, more than enough to make a handful of weapons of a suit of armor.


-Saturn Spray (Modded Fallout) (400CP)
Based on the futuristic space-program alloy ‘Saturnite’, this spray can contains a liquid compound that rapidly hardens into a transparent, protective yet flexible film that bonds onto whatever item it is used on. As in, it turns the item it’s used on effectively invulnerable to ​any damaging or corroding influence, from bullets to plasma and even radiation and rusting. You could spray a Light Machine Gun, and the barrel and firing chamber would never warp or distort from overheating, for example, nor would the paint job flake off or burn up despite the fact the barrel glows red-hot from continued use. Whatever it’s used on simply will not degrade or wear out so long as the spray remains in place. Its flexibility means it doesn’t actually provide any increase in protection (you’ll still suffer internal trauma even if your armor bounces back right after, for example), but you’ll never have to worry about your equipment no longer looking the way it should - or working at less than its original effectiveness, for that matter. Should you want to make some modifications (like changing the paint job to something different), you’ll also receive a spray can with the releasing agent, which will cause the Saturn Spray to harmlessly peel off and degrade into everyday chemical waste. Both cans are effectively ‘bottomless’ and will never run out.




-NZT-48|NZT-48+|NZT-48++ (Limitless) (500CP)
NZT-48 (0CP) You have some pills of NZT-48. This amazing pill lets you easily master many abilities related to the brain, including perfect recall, increased learning speed (fast enough to master the piano in three days), peak human charisma, peak human dexterity and reflexes, hypercompetence, superhuman instincts, peak human sensory absorption, instant analysis, and nigh-unshakable confidence. Unfortunately, the things you learn while using NZT are typically not fully available to you once it wears off.  For free, you receive a replenishing supply and the formula for a version that has a few minor, minor side effects during withdrawal or even with continued usage: memory loss, extreme paranoia, blurred vision, hearing difficulties, psychosis, missing time, skin lesions, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, and Limp Dick Syndrome. So yeah, there is a trade-off for genius in a pill.  For each of these formulas, you may choose to have them work for others or not in future worlds, enabling mass production. However, if they work, others will be able to reverse engineer them so pick your poison. If you choose for them not to work for others, you’ll have to oversee the production personally, but the compounds will be immune to analysis.
NZT-48+ (200CP) You can get a replenishing supply of and the formula for an injectable substance based on a cyclical enzyme system, partially developed by Piper Baird, that temporarily makes one immune to the side effects… in case you want to control the distribution of NZT. You also have access to a version that grants permanent immunity. If you do not purchase this option, the in-jump version of this cyclical enzyme system will not work in future jumps. The enzymes are free if you have the capstone booster and Master Chemist.
NZT-48++ (300CP) You have a replenishing supply of and the formula for a version of NZT-48 that has no side effects.  If you do not purchase this option, you will be unable to upgrade the base version to remove the side effects. This version is free for those who purchase the capstone booster.





-Orgel of Origins (Ar Tonelico) (500CP)
A copy of the original Song Science device. A handheld music box that plays a very carefully calibrated song. It is made of Parameno and Grathnode - and gets hot pretty quickly. Enjoy your white hole generator - this is what powers the entire tower, including the antigravity generators, weather control, and giant beam cannons. All of it. It’s an infinite energy generator, with a very high output. Unless you buy both this and Song Science, replicating it is nearly impossible, with both it is tricky.


-Gatherer's Garden | Adam Slugs (Bioshock 2) (600CP)
Gatherer's Garden (400CP) “My daddy's SMARTER than Einstein, STRONGER than Hercules and lights a fire with a SNAP of his fingers. Are you as good as my daddy, Mister?” This rather cheerful little vending machine will advertise the Plasmids and Tonics inside with the voice of a little girl and a merry melody or two. Unlike other vending machines, this one doesn’t use money, but requires vials of ADAM instead. This one comes stocked with virtually every Plasmid and Tonic Rapture has to offer and never seems to need restocking, but caveat emptor. These ones come with the usual range of side effects that plagued the citizens of the city. So make sure you limit how often people use it or have a steady supply of ADAM on hand. Unless you want to create wild Splicers.
Adam Slugs (200CP) Ugly as they are, these deep sea slugs glow with the bright red of ADAM in their veins. They naturally produce the raw material, which can be harvested from them and easily refined into the necessary building blocks for Plasmids and Tonics. However, harvesting the slugs directly yields very little ADAM and would require dozens to generate a single new Plasmid. But it is what it is. It’s not like you would implant them in little girls and then harvest their blood for larger amounts of ADAM. That would be monstrous. The slugs come in a small aquarium that won’t need maintenance to keep them alive and will refill to contain six slugs every week. Just keep the lid on. They like to wander.


-Element 115 (Call Of Duty Zombies) (600CP)
A metal container, containing an assortment of various forms of Element 115. This stuff can do all sorts of things, but it’s dangerous, so use it wisely. The contents of the container will regenerate once a month.
* Can be used to upgrade any weapon


-Computronium (Eclipse Phase) (600CP)
One cubic foot of grade-A, pure TITAN-manufactured computronium – originally a block of water ice from Iapetus. This is the kind of thing those commie Argonauts would sell their forks into indenture to get one good look at. Whorls of glassy circuitry and fleeting aurora-like flashes of light are trapped within the clear block. Only a high-bandwidth data port betrays its actual purpose. There's more processing power in this one-foot cube than almost any single computer system in the entire solar system (with the possible exception of the rest of the Iapetus matrioshka computer and any other computronium the TITANs have made, of course); it is capable of insanely massive processing feats. It must be kept cool and powered, since it lacks the rest of Iapetus’s infrastructure. It would make excellent substrate to run a Seed AI on.


-"Quirk Enhancement Drug" (My Hero Academia) (600CP) 
This is a powerful type drug that's illegal in numerous countries around the planet. Your specific batch is notable in that it comes from the African continent, which produces the most potent Quirk Enhancement Drugs.
 The drug comes in a large canister held safely within a padded suitcase, enough to fill the six injectors that come with the package deal. Each injector counts as a full dose, and upon usage it massively empowers the user's Quirk for up to two hours straight. A man whose Quirk is the manifestation of 10cm blades from their arms could suddenly start producing branching, hyper sharp blades from their entire body that could punch through concrete and steel like it was butter. A muscle augmentation Quirk could allow someone to turn into a hulking brute that could crater the road with one big punch. These are just examples of what it can do to lesser or basic Quirks. The drug even works on Mutation Quirks with unpredictable results. 
Care must be taken when the drug is applied however, for it has addictive properties and turns the tongue black as a side effect with repeated, allowing heroes and law enforcement to identify frequent users of the illegal drug even if they haven't taken it. Arguably the worst side effect is the mental dimming that causes most who take the drug to be reduced to following their base instincts and thought processors, causing them to become a danger to themselves and others. A recipe for the Quirk Enhancement Drug is included in your suitcase, allowing you to produce more over time. The injectors are self-fixing and self-cleaning after each use to prevent cross contamination.




-AI Seed|Muse AI Import (Eclipse Phase) (650CP)
AI Seed (600CP) A potential Seed AI, capable of the feared “exponential development curve”. It is presently inert in a shoebox-sized processor array. Carefully nurtured in a simulspace and given the right interaction, information and physical resources, it is fully capable of growing into a "friendly" ASI like the Prometheans. If left to its own devices, it will grow into something resembling a pre-Fall TITAN – essentially oblivious to any value a human life holds except strategically. The nascent ASI does not require a companion slot until it reaches human-level intelligence – how long this takes will depend entirely on how you choose to let it develop (with no brakes and free access to hardware, it could race to human level in less than an hour). Firewall and lots of other people will not be happy if they learn you have this.
Muse AI Import (50CP) Ensure the loyalty of your AI, these seed AIs tend to go genocidal otherwise.

Mundane Large Scale Supplies
Items that are large scale for sourcing resources that are not magical, examples would include mines and farms


-Resource Generator (Toaruverse) (100CP) 
Buying materials and resource cost too much time and manpower especially if the materials or resources that you need are limited or rare. You gain a warehouse full of materials and resources no matter how common to how rare it is that you need to build any technology that you want. It replenishes used materials every twenty-four hours after you take it out the warehouse, additionally it records and replenishes any materials that you add in your warehouse. After the jump it would become a warehouse add-on or be inserted near your starting location.
* Gives a rapidly restocking warehouse which contains large amounts of anything that falls under materials and resources that is stored in your warehouse improving most perks that are listed under supplies.


-Fuel Production Facility (Starsector v1.2) (100CP)
A large facility dedicated to the production of fuel. By default, the production facility is configured to produce antimatter fuel, but this can be changed to produce alternative variants of fuel at higher volumes. A single facility is capable of producing enough antimatter every month to supply around 10 capital-hull ships without a problem, or around 3000 units of fuel.


-Nullspace Computer (Megas XLR) (100CP)
 You have a computer tower you can summon from and banish to nullspace. allowing you to upgrade it but otherwise keep it safe. You may summon holographic interface for it at will. 
* Massive upgradable supercomputer that can be kept safe by existing outside reality and simultianiously be used due to its holographic interface making it a extremely useful item which benefits from all abilities which improve its performance while being entirely tamper proof.


-Energy Crystal Generator (I have a mansion in the post apocalypse) (100CP)
Energy crystals are the currency of the future,stonelike, hard crystals that are capable of holding gigantic amounts of energy of any and all kinds. They’re used to fuel tanks, computers, powersuits, everything. And now you have a machine for making them! 
Simply by feeding this machine energy through any of the many input methods it has, you can create charged up crystals, holding that energy in convenient, packet-sized forms that are entirely safe to hold and use, no matter the kind of energy. You can generate these crystals through hooking the machine up to a power outlet, or you can use more... ‘exotic’ means. 
After all, in the Post Apocalypse full of mutants, the most plentiful source of energy are the mutants themselves. They’re harvested for the energy crystals that develop on them, full ofthe radioactive energies that serve in various ways to fuel the industries of this world. Similarly, you can chuck basically anything into this device and if there's any kind of unique or exotic energy to be extracted from it,this machine will do it swiftly and easily.


-Provider chest (Factorio) (100CP)
Whenever you open this space-bending chest, you'll find an assortment of the standard Factorio resources, ready for processing. A variety of mundane wood and stone, pressed coal, iron and copper ingots, uranium slugs in heavy lead containers, and barrels of oil and water. The chest stores about a cubic meter of each material, and withdrawn resources replenish at different rates - you and your companions will easily have enough water to live off of, a good-sized house could be built with a few day's worth of stone and wood, while metals, particularly uranium, are replaced much more slowly. 




-Mountain of Blocks (Warhammer Fantasy: Tomb Kings) (200CP)
To make a tomb, you need stone. Lots of it even. Even an army of skilled workers can’t make a castle from sand. The logistics of getting all the stone out aren’t easy either, sometimes taking weeks of planning and travel to arrive, with any number of things that can go wrong. You need not go through the whole trial like this, since you never run out of stone, rock and other such things. You’re able to bring out endless amounts of mundane stone or rock and though they will need hewing and cutting, the amount you save in money and time will be immense.
* this just give us a bunch of regular mundane stones nothing magical or exotic might be best to remove this
* Potentially useful in the construction of celestial bodies as it is infinite and there is no restocking time.


-Body Shop (Smash Up) (200CP) 
A good scientist pushing the bounds of human knowledge always has a use for… raw materials. Here is a collection of preserved body parts from every species in the world, updating in future Jumps. Just… never ask where it all comes from.
* Extremely useful for any biological projects or research but perk text is slightly concerning if you take it seriously.


-Basic CR-Units (Date a Live) (200CP)  
The bread and butter of the combatants in AST and DEM. CR-Units are… well, they look like a very fit one-piece swimsuit, but they possess an energy shield that protects the user when  active, as well as a variety of deployable weapons and extra armor. The first purchase gives you the ‘basic’ model, used by the grunts around. You can buy this again to get a  personalized version, with upgraded stats and more versatility and firepower, and even once  again to obtain one suit on pair with the most powerful around.


-Mineral Rights (Diabolical) (200CP) 
You have, through some underhanded but fully legal means, acquired a metric ton of rights to various mines and harvesting operations the world over. In practical terms this means you will have a sufficient amount of raw metals, ores, minerals, and other physical resources to build or construct whatever you desire… all without paying a dime for it. You can also sell the excess on the open or black market, or simply stockpile it all for yourself. This will follow you to other Jumps, providing a steady stream of physical resources and allowing you to live the life of a mining magnate, or always have sufficient resources for your industrial ambitions.
* A rare perk in the celestial forge in that it gives direct ownership of something outside the warehouse that isn’t a single building or a business.


-Vibration/Oscillation warhead (Arpeggio of Blue Steel) (200CP)
Humanity's version of the Corrosive torpedo. Disintegrates target at a molecular level by finding the target’s ‘resonance frequency’ and literally vibrating it apart. The Vibration torpedo can defeat any armour made of normal matter – nanomaterials or meter-thick steel, makes no difference, but can’t punch through Klein fields on its own. Superior to the corrosive torpedo, the Vibration warhead requires no exotic matter or nanotech: it can be mass produced by any reasonably sophisticated factory. This is a full load for your vessel, plus the schematics.




-Eufiber tumor (Trinity:Aberrant) (300CP) 
Don't show this to anyone unless you want to deal with some very awkward questions. Somehow you've acquired a small piece of Anibal Buendia's tissue floating in a nutrient bath, or something very much like it, that secretes strands of living Eufiber. You can use the Eufiber to make Quantum-Attuning suits. Living Eufiber also interacts with other powers in strange ways – it is known that cyberkinetic powers are boosted when working with computers linked by a Living Eufiber network they are Attuned to. Finding other uses for this material will require experimentation on your part.


-Store of Omni-Metals (Larfleeze) (300CP)
A cargo ship carrying 40 million cubic feet of omnimetal, enough to build several buildings' worth. They predate the current multiverse by a large margin, and are especially attuned to the nature of spatial dimensions. Because of this they're extremely useful in technology involving warping space and bridging between dimensions, making building such creations far easier than they would be otherwise. Your supply is restocked at the beginning of each jump or 10 years.
* An absolutely massive cargo spaceship contain colossal amounts of restocking space and dimension bending metals which predate the creation of one of the DC Multiverses.


-Need More (Bladerunner 2049) (400CP) 
Replicants aren’t exactly made from clay. The biological materials that go into them take facilities to produce and can get rather expensive to make each and every one individually. You won’t have that supply issue however as you’ve got a seemingly endless supply of the raw biological materials needed to make a Replicant. Or a human. Not too different in the end, you know? You’ll receive enough to make at least a dozen Replicants each day and it’ll always refill the next day over.


-Sample Collection (Generic Naruto Fanfiction) (400CP)
Oh, what’s this now? Doing some experiments, are we? Well, if you are, these would be priceless. This is a comprehensive collection of DNA samples, with blood, hair, nails and even bone samples from... well, just about everyone who’s anyone! 
That’s right. This is a collection of neatly labeled samples that have materials from very nearly every powerful ninja, samurai, random guy, demon, sage... pretty much anyone who can be considered A-class or above in the Bingo Book. The exact nature and quantity of the samples depends on the people in question and their histories. That is, someone who keeps getting injured would likely have extensive blood samples here, but for someone for whom it’s a rarity you would likely see only stuff like hair and skin, and quantities dependant on how easy it tends to ordinarily be to get those things from them. 
The exception is for dead people, in which case you get significant quantities of everything from blood, bone, skin... well, everything. Each and every sample is perfectly preserved, and experiments performed on them have significantly higher chances of success than normal. In future jumps too, you get samples from all major figures in the setting, whether in terms of fighting strength, intellect or the rest.
* Saves anybody interested in acquiring the genetics of significant characters from all the work and risk involved.
* Unlike the Dragon Ball genetic sample item this includes unique individuals.
* Fiat backing improved odds of success in any experiment utilising them.


-Supply Cache (Batman Beyond) (400CP)
Each purchase of this will grant you 1 of two large stores of replenishing resources that can be used for a wide variety of projects. The first cache contains a large amount of mechanical and electronic parts that can be used build or repair a wide array of weapons, gadgets, equipment, and cybernetics similar to what Batman and his enemies use. The second cache is filled with an incredible amount of chemicals, compounds and other substances that can be used to create things like biological mutagens, steroids, drugs, and deadly toxins.


-Crystal Garden (Azeroth) (400CP)
You now possess the very same crystals used by the Draenei in many of their creations. This single man sized crystal, when planted, can create a massive mine filled with even more crystals of varying shapes, sizes, and colors. The mine may be temporarily depleted if you harvest too much too quickly, but it will regenerate more crystals for you to harvest if given a month to rest. The crystals you mine from this can be planted into other areas to create new mines. However, these new mines will not regenerate after use and once empties the land will need time to replenish the necessary nutrients before you can plant more crystals. If you purchase The Mine then you will have an entire floor dedicated to these crystals within your mine.


-Junkyard (Mass Effect Andromeda) (400CP)
 Junk to some is treasure to others. You get a doorway that leads to a small pocket universe that is filled with the local area’s lost, broken and/or discarded items. You might find broken gear, ruined vehicles, or maybe a pristine limited edition item that someone just forgot about. Everything in here will be somewhat useful to you, but you get to decide if it’s use is as a source of resources, or if something is worth fixing.The doorway takes the appearance of an expandable hula hoop that opens a portal to the pocket universe.
The pocket universe will refill with junk as you travel, or as the local area around you generates junk that will be siphoned off. In addition, if you haven’t cleared out the junk universe in one jump, then you can still pick it up in another, while the junk from the new jump will slowly filter in as space is opened up.


-God program (Overwatch) (400CP)
Well now, this is extremely surprising. You've come into possession of a powerful AI bearing extremely close resemblance to those that led the first omnic crisis. This supercomputer is both fully sapient and unfalteringly loyal to you. Possessed of the most advanced hardware in this world, it is able to process extremely fast calculations. It also possessed the greatest ability of the God programs: the ability to infect and control other technology. If its existence becomes known, expect to deal with hostility and fear from almost everyone, human and omnic alike.


-Box of Resources (Mass Effect Andromeda) (600CP)
 Have a box full of the Heleus cluster’s resources! Great for all your crafting needs, and ensures that you can always use your Andromeda gear. Omni-gel canisters, eezo, angaran meditation crystals, kett alloys, remnant polymers, eiroch fluid sacs, remnant cores, renderable plates, scale fibers, shell filaments, soft chitin.
You will have to find your own source of the non-exclusive minerals though. This box is as big as the shipping container for the Nomad, is equally divided amongst the 11 resources, and will refill itself once a week. Post Jump, instead of a single shipping container divided amongst the resources, you get a shipping container of each resource, and they all refill monthly. In addition, anytime you run into a universe specific material that you regularly use for crafting, another shipping container will be added. You must have used that material for crafting purposes several times before it would count.


-Atlesian Contacts (In the Kingdoms Service) (600CP) 
​​An established group that will approach you if you are ever looking to start up a large enterprise. They will offer advanced technology, very low-interest loans, expertise, and their own services to help you get your enterprise up off the ground, and will support you until you are fully capable of standing on your own two feet (so long as you are also putting in effort). Even beyond this, they will be a friendly competitor so long as you remain on at least neutral terms. The level of help they will offer will adjust based on the setting, but it will always be at least enough to turn a group of (skilled and informed) teenagers into a major intelligence agency.






-Black Market (Ben 10.01) (600CP) 
What, did you think it was all about cars? It’s great as a hobby but you’ve got to make some money. To do that, you’ve got some connections. Whether it’s  some secure communication channels or meeting places, you’ve got your fingers in the criminal underworld of the universe. If you need to buy or sell something off the table these are the guys you want to call. If there’s some kind of commercially available weapon, gadget, or vehicle of dubious legality you need to get and have its IDs removed, they can do it for pretty reasonable prices. They’re not so good at finding super rare or unique items, but just about everything else is fair game. Just as well, if you need something to disappear or be sold, they’ll take it off your hands and you will  never see it again for a pretty substantial amount of cash. Pretty weirdly loyal for criminal underworld types too...as long as you don’t sell them out or give them trouble, they’ll be happy to do business with you wherever, whenever.




-Amber Ogia Farm (Ben 10) (600CP)
A fruit native to Revonnah that grow in the cracks found in boulders. Amber ogia can be turned into clothes, fuel for ships and weapons, and even a meal that give your body everything it needs to survive. This is just the tip of the amber ogia iceburg though, with the right knowledge and some work you could find other amazing uses for it, such as creating a mind control potion. Despite all attempts to grow this wondrous fruit on other planets, amber ogia always produces a poor and sickly crop unless grown on its home world. Even artificially constructed farm planets fail. Luckily for you, you own a hectare of land on Revonnah that‘s perfect for growing amber ogia. The best thing about this plot of land is even if you strip the place completely clean of amber ogia vines, they will eventually start growing again anyway. Post-Jump, your farm will automatically be connected to your warehouse.




-Genetic Database (SB Dragonball Z) (600CP) 
Having a genetic database of all the known races in the universe might seem a bit overboard, but I’m sure many would disagree with that notion. This item is just what it says on the can. You have both the genetic sequences, and copious DNA samples from all the races within the Dragonball Universe. While individual mutations or rare developments are excluded, you still have a lot to work with. The entire database comes in the form of a knee high box with a terminal on it. Searching this terminal and choosing something will cause it to open up revealing the samples/information. Everything inside regenerates within a day.


-RECYCLER AND FABRICATOR | OPERATOR DISPENSER  (PREY) (700CP)
RECYCLER AND FABRICATOR (400 CP) Perhaps one of the most innovative technologies TranStar has developed after Neuromods. Recyclers breakdown material into its constituent components, by default these are "Organic", "Mineral", "Synthetic" and "Exotic", to be used in the fabricator. Providing that you have a compatible schematic small enough to fit inside the fabricator and the correct materials, the fabricator can craft complex items such as Q-Beams, turrets and Neuromods.
OPERATOR DISPENSER (300CP) An unlocked robot fabricator which can create one of 4 different types of "operators". Medical Operators heal the injured, Engineering Operators repair systems like your suit, Science Operators replenish your Psi and Military "Black Box" Operators come equipped with offensive lasers. Comes with 3 charges and will need 3 units of Synthetic, Mineral and Organic material to create a new charge.




-Chronos Supply | Chronos Supply+ | Chronos Supply++ (Katana Zero) (2200CP)
Chronos Supply (600CP) This is a case of 10 Chronos syringes, there is nothing special about the syringes or the Chronos contained within (aside from the usual), and the case replenishes at the end of every week. 
Chronos Supply+ (600CP) A shipping container containing about 1000 doses that replenish each week, and the formula to make Chronos. 
Chronos Supply++ (1000CP) The third and final option nets you the same as the second option, but without the side effects, this nets you a shipping container full of side effect less Chronos and the recipe to make more. Taking this improved version of Chronos will purge a person of their addiction and can reverse some symptoms of withdrawal.

Magical Small Scale Supplies
Items that are supernatural but on a small scale. An example would include a small box of magical metals.


-Stabilized Moonsilver (Exalted - The Lunars) (50CP)
Deposits of Moonsilver form only in the Wyld. Beams of moonlight unpredictably illuminate a region of the Bordermarches or Middlemarches, boiling off the Wyld and distilling its Essence into the fluid, watery-looking moonsilver. However, raw moonsilver is unstable. An artisan needs special techniques to work it. Through coaxing songs and careful taps and strokes with crystal hammers and probes, the artisan quiets the Wyldness remaining in the raw moonsilver so it becomes a stable metal. Pacify it too much and it freezes into silver; hit it too hard, and it shatters into drops of quicksilver.
This does mean that in other worlds, you might have some difficulty finding any quantities of Moonsilver to use. Therefore, you may purchase a supply of moonsilver here. Gaining five Talents of pure, stabilized Moonsilver for you to use, enough for the creation of most any kind of artifact, as well as notes detailing the thaumaturgical procedure that may be used to create Moonsilver yourself. In the future, you will gain another five Talents of this mutable metal every year, ensuring that you will never permanently run out.


-Chalcanth (Exalted - The Infernals) (50CP)
The life force of a demon preserved in vitriol, chalcanth appears as a cupful of vibrant liquid. The color and consistency of any given dose varies with its origin, but the fluid always stirs restlessly of its own accord and issues a faint susurrus, as the demon liquified in its creation still lives. Chalcanth’s primary purpose is the creation of infernal relics, but that is not its only use. Many in Malfeas seek it out as an intoxicating source of essence, because if one drinks it they will be energized as the flavors of the demon’s mind and soul tumble through the drinker’s brain in a synesthetic wash of images and emotions. With one purchase of this, you will gain a cupful of high quality Chalcanth once every five days.


-Purest Vitriol (Exalted - The Infernals) (50CP)
Passive and reactive in nature, Vitriol was designed by the Primordials to catalyze evolutionary transformation in matter and Essence. But in the millennia since the Primordial War, the Yozis’ loathing for their jailers, their captivity, and their own broken natures has permeated the very nature of vitriol, infusing it with their hate. Now, it consumes all that it encounters. The stuff bubbles in open pits laden with the detritus of all that it has dissolved, and these impurities must be removed before the vitriol may be used for magical purposes. With one purchase of this, you will gain a weekly supply of enough pure Vitriol to dissolve a demon in or baptise one relic smaller than a vehicle.


-Exotic Components (Exalted - The Infernals) (50CP)
Artificers of hell construct their relics with a greater pool of exotic reagents than those of Creation-made artifacts, for the world-bodies of the Yozi are rich with alien metals, stones and woods, not to mention the tissues and excretions of countless species of lesser demons, animals, plants and other entities that mortal savants might not even recognize as life. Of course, while these many be easy to come across in hell itself, not all Infernals have the luxury of staying there whenever they work on their relics. So with one purchase of this, you will gain a starting wealth of exotic components and an additional weekly supply of more than enough to construct a lesser relic, straight from the Demon Realm.


-Golden coin pouch (Overlord: Light novel) (50CP)
You’ve got access to a money pouch filled with a ‘respectable' amount of gold coins. Respectable by the standards of a max level Yggdrasil Player at least. This amount of gold is enough to beggar the imagination of commoners and even landed nobility will consider it a ruinously large sum, easily into the tens of thousands. If you’re a Player it’s minted with YGGDRASIL iconography and is probably what you had in your inventory when you arrived in the New World, they’re sure to attract attention if you use them. If you’re a local it’s in local denominations, and god knows how you came across it. For 50 CP you have ten times as much gold, and you’ll find that every month any gold you’ve spent or expended has been replaced within the pouch. The pouch itself can hold any number of gold coins, but only gold coins, inside of it.
One notable fact regarding these coins, and indeed Yggdrasil Gold Coins in general, is that they can substitute for many types of incidental materials or reagents when it comes to creating magical items or artifacts. For example as long as you have a scroll to work with the gold could substitute for inks to allow you to make a magic scroll, or special oils or unguents in a bit of clockwork, and so on and so forth. Hell, you can even use the stuff to garnish food and drink at no risk to the consumer. Basically, so long as you’ve got the “main” pieces for making something you can substitute in some Yggdrasil Gold for any of the incidental bits required in the process.




-Magical Ore (Everyone Else is a Returnee) (100CP)
What is a smith without some metal to work with? Equipment plays a large part in this world, and a craftsman can only do so much without good materials. Luckily you happen to have a large storage box filled with lumps of unrefined ores of many varieties. The rarity and value of these ores range from normal iron all the way to precious ores of heaven, with the quantity of the ores being inversely proportional to their value. As you travel to future jumps, this box will update to include for the various ores you encounter. I hope you have some way of refining and forging them. Each month, the box will refill.


-Dye and Paint (Terraria - Journey's End) (100CP)
A selection of paints and dyes that can be used to color various objects or furniture. Each hue has enough to paint two or three objects, and restocks in a day once used. This also comes with a set of brushes, rollers, and scrapers that you can use to apply or remove the dyes and paints. To start with, you have all of the basic, bright, deep, and gradient hues. For an extra 50 CP, you gain the strange, lunar, shadow, negative, and illuminant hues.


-Monster Hunted (Everyone Else is a Returnee) (100CP)
Metal and stone are only a small group of materials used in the creation of equipment. Much more prevalent is the use of the flesh of monsters. From the feathers to the fur to the blood of them, every part of a monster can be used for something by a skilled craftsman. Luckily you just so happen to have a replenishing supply of monster bits. You can choose the class of monster flesh you receive, though the stronger the material the less of it will be supplied.
You may only get a handful of 5th class feathers, while you could get a metric ton of 1st class scales. New material is supplied each month. Among these you may even get some magic cores.


-Elemental Seeds (World Seed) (100CP)
An elemental seed is the condensed essence of an element, and they’re almost exclusively produced by Druids or Mages capable of creating enchantments replicating their methods. They have various uses, such as powering enchantments or magical items, and are required in the process of giving an object an elemental ability. Druids also use them to introduce new elements into their Grove, and need them to cultivate their affinities past the 25% point. As such, each of them is fairly valuable, with the price skyrocketing once you go beyond the basic seven elements and to incredibly rare ones such as Time. 
They are also pretty time intensive to make, requiring about an hour of work for each, even for people relatively skilled in their creation. But now, you won’t ever have to worry about that, as you’ll get a dozen Seeds for each of your affinities delivered either to your warehouse or another place you designate, every week. Their quality depends on the level of your affinities: from 5% to 25% you’ll get low-grade ones, from 25% to 50% medium-grade ones, from 50% to 75% high-grade ones, and finally, from 75% up to 100% you’ll get top-grade seeds.




-Raw Materials (Elder Scrolls Online) (100CP)
About 20 ingots worth of dwemer metal, a few honing stones, and a set of hammers and tongs. Used materials refill once a year. Not exactly powerful in the more high-tech settings, but being able to craft items out of a metal that never really rusts is something that won’t ever go out of style. Or you could always just sell it off. This is almost 600 crowns worth of eternally respawning refined metal and smithing equipment just sitting on the ground after all.

Medium sized, this bag contains an assortment of random ores and metals for you to work with, from cheap iron to Tauru ore which is one of the hardest known ores around, the quality and quantity of these materials will vary from day to day and sometime will drop some really  precious minerals.

This is an unending supply of samples from both awakened, and unawakened Asarakam, by combining them together you can create another form of parasitic life that can infect humans turning them into Yoma. This supply also includes yoma flesh and blood, just because you might not want to bother with  the other steps.


-Iron Rose (Circle of Magic) (200CP)
You gain a rose bush made of living iron. If placed in contact with a pure sample of any metal, it will generate buds and eventually roses of that metal. Such roses can be harvested, then planted to transform more and more of that metal into living metal slowly over time. They must be planted in soil rich in that metal, or in a pot full of clay and chunks of said metal to grow properly. Should you tend these roses long enough for them to bear seeds, the plants that grow from these seeds will transform base metals into whatever metal they grew from.
* Can make the same living metal as the other perk, except does not require you to peel off your own skin.


-Crate of Adamantine (Dungeon Keeper Ami) (200CP)
 Adamantine, the rare metal forged by the dwarves of the frozen north. This metal is the result of a dreadful battle between the gods of light and the gods of darkness, this metal is all that remains of a once mighty god of light that fell to earth while killing a dark god, after many years his flesh was changed and warped till it became the metal adamantine, nearly impossible to forge without the correct knowledge this metal is nearly indestructible and harms creatures of evil like fire while blocking dark magic completely. You now have a crate of this amazing metal and shall receive a new crate once a year. Though this may not seem like much especially with the requirements on forging it, you need not worry. This Adamantine will work as if it were normal steel up until its first forging after which its normal


-Magic MetaMaterials (With this Ring) (200CP)
​We hear about swords and armor made of Orihalcum, Mithril, and Jovium, but there are far better uses for these wondrous materials. Jovium is a perfect​ conductor of heat and electricity, Orihalcum and Mithril hold a magical charge and enchantment far more effectively than ordinary materials, and both are far stronger than their weight would suggest for metals. You receive a metric ton of these three metals for use in any military or industrial project you like, and instructions for producing more. The process, however, of synthesizing common alloys into magical metamaterials requires either a familiarity with metal typically found in journeyman level craftsmen who shape metal such as blacksmiths, welders, and jewelers, or familiarity with arcane practices found in journeyman level enchanters or artificers.


-Sacks​ ​of​ ​Essences (Divinity - Original Sin)​ (200CP)
These five head sized burlap sacks are extremely light despite the fact they look to be filled to bursting and each emits a faint light from the seams, a different color coming from each. A fiery red, a gentle blue, a brilliant white, a somber brown, and... is that fifth one emitting shadows? Small balls of solidified elemental essences are not a rare commodity in Rivellon and have a huge variety of uses in everything from specialized grenades to magical arrow heads to even aiding in enchanting arms and armor. Each sack contains five balls of each element and the sacks refill themselves every week. What use you put these concentrated bits of elemental magic is limited only by your imagination and experimentation. Just don’t get opposing elements too close to each other. The result is fairly explosive, doubly so if you are enchanting at the time.  


-Resolute Thread (Skulduggery Pleasant v1.05) (200CP)
You have a spool of thread that's supposedly made from the stomach lining of an Emperor Dragon over 2000 years ago. The more pressure applied to it, the stronger it becomes. You could bind a superhuman or use it to hang hundreds of tons off of the ground. Spool refills and used thread once a month.


-Endless bag of nether warts (Minecraft) (200CP)
You get a small bag which inexplicably contains a full stack of Nether Wart. It refills once a week. The crucial ingredient in all Minecraft potions, brew it with water and any of a vast array of ingredients to create a magical potion. Also comes with a Brewing Stand.


-Bottomless Bucket (Terraria - Journey's End) (200CP)
A fairly large metal bucket, which, when filled with a liquid, can pour out infinite amounts of said liquid unless deliberately completely emptied. It will resist cold, heat, corrosion, and other damaging properties of whatever liquid fills it, and when deliberately emptied, no traces or cross-contamination will happen when the bucket is refilled. 


-Crafting Materials (Generic Isekai Replacement Anon version) (200CP)
You have a collection of respawning supernatural crafting materials from this world.


-Gifts from Above (The Legend of Zelda Breath of the Wild) (200CP)
Once per day, you can call upon the powers of the Amiibo for a gift. A rain of food or monster parts will fall from the sky nearby, and rarely, they will be accompanied by a metal chest. Inside the chest can be almost anything, from a bundle of arrows to a weapon to a bottle of potion.


-Vibranium Sample (MCU) (200CP)
Vibranium is an extremely rare element that possesses unique attributes. In a pure mass, vibranium forms a solid metal that is stronger than steel, but only a third of the weight, as well as being completely vibration absorbent. This means it can absorb the impacts of a great deal of attacks, but bear in mind high-energy attacks WILL do damage... especially if it is consistent. Purchasing this gets you a container a foot in length with some Wakandan Vibranium shards that will replenish itself every month.


-Adamantium (X-Men Evolution) (200CP)
You receive a case of liquid adamantium which is the hardest material in this world. This nigh-indestructible metal once solidified in anything won’t be melted and is practically impossible to destroy. You contain more than enough to do something like Weapon X and still have plenty left over. You’ll of course receive more adamantium each month.


-Monster Killing Metals (Percy Jackson And The Olympians) (200CP)
About ten pounds of Celestial Bronze, Imperial Gold or Stygian Iron. All made to destroy godly and monstrous creatures (save the last, which also hurts mortals) weapons crafted from these materials are incredibly durable and able to hold enchantments of the like seen in ancient myth. Your supply restocks every two weeks, with the type of metal delivers being of your choice.


-Ore Merchant (Darksoul 2) (200CP) 
You have just gained the partnership of a travelling merchant, one who has an inventory that you’re sure to find interesting. This travelling merchant sells a bizarrely large quantity of exotic stones with you getting a special discount. You always seem to be able to find them when you look hard enough, though never in the direct line of danger. While their inventory is always bizarrely large, you can still buy them out if you have the currency to back it up, whatever that may be locally. If you do, they’ll disappear for a while to restock. In future worlds they will continue to sell the various stones and ores of this world such as Titanite or Boltstone, but will also temporarily stock themselves with whatever earthen curiosities can be found in the world around them. Limited time offers! They’re practically giving this stuff away!


-Grathmeld Supplies (Ar Tonelico) (200CP)
You receive a 1m white ceramic cube, which contains 250 kilograms of randomised base components and Grathnode crystals. Stocks replenish every week, and ratios skew towards whatever ingredients you used the most of.


-Philosopher´s Stone(I Saved Too Many Girls And Caused the Apocalypse) (200CP) 
One of alchemy’s greatest secrets and goals. Can be used as a core to create homunculi, make special alchemical compounds or even cure for any and all diseases. The philosopher’s stone is one and yet all. All and yet one. A single philosopher’s stone can serve any function, but it cannot be separated from its purpose, so you can’t separate it or use it for multiple things at once.


-Woden’s Blood (uber) (200CP) 
An unrefined sample of the world shaking substance used to catalyse the transformation from normal human to superhuman weapon, containing eight portions. Each portion can, with proper knowledge and technology, be refined to be used as any one unit of catalyst of the basic activation sequences. Alternatively the entire eight portions can be refined for use in one  of the Special Activations. 
Replenishes once per month. Acts as a highly lethal contact poison to any person without the potential to receive Activations. Using an unrefined portion of Woden’s Blood on a person with the potential to receive further Activations grants half a Physical and Halo Activation each and has the chance to horribly deform the recipient.


-Crystal Concepts(Kingdom Hearts) (200CP) 
You possess the unusual ability to find tangible concepts, often used in this setting to create items through Synthesis. Nothingness, evil, darkness, light, sadness etc. You can now find distilled physical versions of normally abstract concepts left behind by defeated enemies, or hidden in obscure and hard to reach places. These concepts are typically related to the place or enemies you obtain the from, such as fiery enemies or locales holding Fire Shards, or a lightning dragon dropping a Lightning Crystal. The quality of the item depends on the difficulty of obtaining it, ranging from Shards from weak enemies, up to Stone, Gem, and finally Crystal for the progressively tougher enemies. What you do with them is up to you; they’d make nice jewellery, that’s true, but I’m sure you can find a better use for crystallised fire or hope. In jump this means you find significantly more Synthesis ingredients you can either use, or sell.


-Songstone Composer (Ar Tonelico) (200CP)
Another 1m cube. This produces the essential elements of Song Science, in the form of 1 ton each week of Songstone rubble, a crystalline ore of Parameno, Grathnode and Ardel. By itself, Songstone converts sound into magic, storing it until a threshold is reached and it explodes in a burst of wild energy - making them effective improvised grenades. Extracted and refined, their true potential can be reached. Parameno absorbs sound as magic, Grathnode emits it as magic, and Ardel acts as a semiconductor.


-Soft Stick (World Seed) (200CP)
One of the technological staples in Neolife, these special devices are basically CDs for magic. Each Soft Stick is capable of holding a single program that can be erased or replaced as needed. Once a program is uploaded, the aura of the Soft Stick will shift to match it, making it an easy matter to convert any software you might write into a magical formation or enchantment with the same effect, and even doing things such as transferring an AI to an enchantment wouldn’t be much trouble. Furthermore, since the companion bracelet is a suitable terminal to upload software to and from, you wouldn’t even need any other equipment. With this purchase, you gain an endless supply of these useful little things, working with any code or software you might write, no matter how obscure or complicated.


-Charms, Talismans and Sutras (The Irregular At The Magic Highschool) (200CP)
This is a supply of ingredients for Ancient Magic, including prepared spell cards, spirit charms and various talismans. They replenish each day after being used.


-An Artificer's Dream​ (Generic Exalted) (250CP)
You now have Jade, Orichalum, Starmetal, Soulsteel, and Adamant provided for you in your warehouse, roughly 50lbs worth of each per week.


-Arcane Resources (Ravenwood) (300CP)
A supply of high quality, magically-active materials. Such materials are useful in the process of casting spells of various sorts, able to act as foci for various spells, or can be used in the creation of potions or artefacts (as described in the Natural Magic perk). Comes with several schematics for potions and artefacts that can be made with these materials. Additionally, this comes with a travel case that can contain up to 16 potions. Potions contained within this imprint to the slot they are placed in for the next 24 hours, at which point the potions respawn the day after they are used. Placing a different potion in the slot allows it to imprint the new potion.


-Mana Gems (World Seed) (300CP)
One rather important power source used in many energy-hungry magitech devices, and also popular with mages and enchanters, are mana gems. But due to their nature, they cannot be artificially created, only forming after several years of mana condensing and purifying in a single location. This commonly happens only on asteroids, where they can be left undisturbed for long periods of time, and truly vast mana veins can form. But even as mining them can be a hassle, their value makes it worth anyone’s while, as they are capable of holding and regenerating massive amounts of mana, with the exact volumes depending on the gem’s size and quality. And it seems like you’ve hit the jackpot, as with this you’ll be able to gain a steady supply of mana gems each week. You may decide on a case by case basis whether you want several dozen small and low-quality mana gems, or two to three big and high-quality ones.


-Aethertapping (Aion) (400CP) 
 You have been taught how to extract Aether from vortices, which can then be used by daeva to catalyze their crafting.  Post-Jump, you will be able to find the occasional vortice-like anomaly spread across the setting seemingly at random, which you will be able to draw aether out of.  They’ll be invisible and undetectable to anyone who doesn’t have this perk, however. 
          An extra 200cp will grant you mastery in this art, and make post-jump vortice-anomalies considerably more common.  


-A Piece of Shit… Dragon Shit That Is!(SAO abridged) (400CP) 
A legendary crafting material, this can be used to create the most powerful melee weapon in the game. Whether you want a sword, axe, hammer or whatever, just put this on an anvil, focus on what you want, hit it with a hammer and boom, instant master weapon! It’s nigh unbreakable, only able to be destroyed by the one who made it, or divine-level hax, should that happen, the weapon will shatter, and this will reappear in your warehouse immediately. If you want, you can instead use this process to enhance a weapon you already own, absorbing its qualities into the metal permanently, should this process render the metal truly unbreakable, you can still break it if you really want to and still work it just as easily as ever


-Gemavic (Gemcraft-Frostborn Wrath) (400CP)
This perk allows you to summon gems made of different materials using gemcraft, including materials from other jumps. This only works if the material is a transparent or translucent crystal, unfortunately. Most materials are much worse for conducting magic than crystalized mana, but perhaps you can find a use for a diamond the size of a living room? Non-Magical gems are exceptionally cheap to create… you know, since they’re essentially sparkly paperweights. Feel free to be creative with shapes.


-Forbidden Treasure(Generic Exalted) (400CP) 
You looking for some weird stuff? Maybe the bottled laughter of a newborn infant, or the dream of a maddened artist? How about the color of the sunset as seen from a specific mountain peak found only in The South? Well if you buy this option you'll have those things. 200cp gets you a regular source every week in your warehouse of relatively hard to find exotic resources and reagents which can be used to dramatically aid in the speed and efficiency of artifact creation. For 400cp you get a larger amount every week of far more exotic things. Trapped Essence of Yozi, a fragment of the twisted dreams of the Neverborn, and a thousand and one things never before seen or imagined spawned from the twisting madness found only in the absolute heart of the Wyld. You may direct what specific kind of resource you get each week if you have some specific need or desire in mind, and may freely choose something different the next week.


-Potted​ ​Stardust​ (Divinity - Original Sin)​ (400CP)
The Stardust plant is a hardy, quick growing flower with peachy-red colored petals standing up on spindly stalks with large, wide fern-like leaves growing from the base. It is highly sought after by women who use the golden dust that clings to its flower petals to enhance their beauty, but that is only the least of its uses. The golden dust is highly magical and can be easily used for crafting a variety of magical items. Everything from magical swords to voodoo dolls can be created with a pouch full of this stuff. The flower in this pot will generate one small pouch of dust every few days and will never need tending to. Should it be killed, a fresh pot will appear in your proximity within a week.  


-Terragene Crystals (MCU2) (400CP)
There’s dangerous items, and then there’s this thing. A relic from the Kree Empire, these crystals are often sealed inside a container called a Diviner in order to ensure the mist that these crystals spread is kept in check. Why so? Well, the mist causes any who contain the right genetic code to undergo Terrigenesis, where their body becomes enveloped in a stonelike cocoon before breaking open and granting superhuman powers... sometimes with physical changes to help. If they don’t have the proper genetic code, then they merely turn to stone before crumbling into pieces. Do be careful.




-Seeds of Potential (Exalted - The Infernals) (400CP)
Just as Malfeas has its own forms of vegetation, so too does it have its own forms of farming. These plants tend to be made of metals such as tin or brass, though the will of a powerful demon can result in other substances. As the woods of Creation, these metal-woods can be set aflame, albeit only through a specific method employing a firedrill, logs from Vitalius or Hrotsvitha, and demon ichor. Other sorts of fire will not ignite metallic Malfean vegetation, and their metallic flames might melt other sorts of fuel but will not set them afire. Paper will not burn on a fire of metallic logs, and would only be heated. If smelted and cast into new form, the metals of Malfeas lose this property. Their means of cultivation also diverge greatly from those found in Creation. Malfean crops rarely require anything so simple as plowing, sowing and reaping. Instead, they might require to be grown from human finger bones planted in the ground, bear fruit only to the beating of drums, or release their harvest only at the sacrifice of a living demon.
Now I will offer to you a collection of five kinds of seeds. One kind of the ivy of gray lead, one of the bloodmelon vines, one of the malice-nut tree, one of the squash vines of black porcelain, and one of the brass-stemmed roses with petals of green-black glass that grow only in rare parts of hell. All of these will grow where you will, as long as they are properly cared for, and the collection will replenish in number in case you wish to start additional gardens.
And lastly, I shall offer you these three seeds of potential, harvested from Oramus' slumbering temple-body. While they come in lesser number, and will not be replaced as the collection of lesser seeds will be, they are far more remarkable. For if they are pierced by a spike of metal or any other material and planted in the ground, and then regularly fed with a prayer for its growth, these will grow into the seedlings of new trees or plants incorporating the spike's materials. Of course, as a new species you'll have to discover the ways to cultivate them further yourself, and the rarer materials may give you more difficulty... but with a wise selection of ores and minerals, it may be well worth it.


-Lifeblood Weapon (Desolate Era II) (400CP)
Lifeblood Weapons are tools that grow with those they are bound to. This particular weapon comes in whatever form you wish, even as a set of weapons, and is already at the level of a Chaos Weapon. Unlike other lifeblood weapons, all this one needs is to feed on your energy to grow to your level of power. It is however much quicker to feed it precious materials. You may import any past weapons into this role.
* Chaos Weapons can destroy solar system sized mini universes with one swing.


-Ritual Pigments (Dishonored 2) (400CP)
A selection of paint pigments in more than a dozen colours, each colour conveniently prepared from precise ingredients and according to very specific methods needed to use paintings as a ritual for conducting sympathetic magic – no need to wait for certain phases of the moon, nor collect certain weeds in a container made of a human skull. Put simply, what you paint in the painting can be imposed onto reality, or what is in reality can be transferred into the painting. 
There are enough pigments here to do one painting which affects a room-sized area, allowing goods to be conjured, things within the area to be altered or removed, or to turn the painting itself into a room-sized pocket dimension. You could paint a painting of an empty room and add in a pile of silver to the painting, to sympathetically conjure a pile of silver into the real room, or you could paint a picture of the room without its door, which will magically remove the door from the wall of the real room, preventing all access. 
Unfortunately painting ephemeral things – souls, magic, auras, power – still does not make them appear in reality. You could also use these paints to “move” something out of reality and into the painting, such as valuables or a prisoner, concealing or trapping them inside it. If you should possess Voidheart and Endless Black, you will find the scale of this power magnified – you could create an entire world of phantasy within the painting to enter, or call forth from your canvas a change to affect an entire city.


-Alchemic Metals (Generic Isekai) (400CP)
A cubic meter each of mithril, adamant its, and orichalcum. Each of these metals is incredibly scarce and powerful, possessing unique properties. Mythril is highly conductive to energy, unnaturally light despite its hardness, and blades made of it will not dull when cutting mundane materials. Adamantite is considered to be the second hardest substance on earth, and is highly magic resistant, allowing most spells to simply slide off it. Orichalcum, called the divine metal, will resist any external force short of the divine and has no known melting point. This supply restocks once per jump, but there are rumours of a method to synthesise these metals from base ingredients; a method that has been lost for centuries.


-Bag​ ​of​ ​Junk​ (Divinity - Original Sin) (400CP)
 A large sack that seemed filled with the oddest assortment of trash and rubbish you’ve ever seen. There’s a bottle of mud that seems to swirl inside its jar no matter how hard you shake it or how long you leave it to rest on a shelf. There’s an amulet of battered tin in the shake on a buffalo. There’s a shrivelled old heart that somehow is still weakly beating and warm to the touch. There’s even an old sabre in here, rusted and chipped and all but falling apart. Seriously, what is all this even good for?
* The Notes say that stuff is used to craft legendary swords in the game


-Refined Ichor (Nexus) (400CP)
This small jug is filled with the refined ichor of a hacker. Worth its weight in gold, this substance is useful for a number of purposes. Most commonly, it is used alongside Mist Alchemy in enhancing a material or object or to directly enhance the effects of Mist Alchemy. Further refinement turns it into essence, which can temporarily boost one’s Light as if they’d cracked a blank seed or it can be mixed with other substances to give a minor increase in Light, this is an incredibly small boost, but is noticeable. It can also be used in manipulating
Mist, making refinement more precise, improving cultivation results, and making smelting easier. Finally, it can be used to enhance the innate physical ability of the user, though how this is done is only known by the demons of the Border Ring. There may be other uses, but they are largely unknown.




-Soul Gems | Azura’s Star (Elder Scrolls Online / Morroblivion) (500CP)
Soul Gems (100CP) An essential tool for enchanters and mages, yet one that's only recently gained formal recognition. You have five Petty, four Common and Lesser, three Greater and Grand, and two Black soul gems all held in a tasteful keshweed fiber satchel. Each gem holds a soul of its corresponding size, color, and power. For example, a Petty gem would hold a rabbit or a small dog at most, while a Grand would hold a mammoth or a strong Daedra. These are both White souls and can be held in White gems. The rarer Black soul gems hold the souls of sapient creatures, like humans, beast folk, or elves. You can use them as arcane batteries, as focuses for spells, or just as general magic storage. You'll get a new set every month of whatever's been depleted. Remember to be careful handling the Black gems, as they can have unfortunate and potentially lethal side-effects if not contained properly.
Azura’s Star (400CP) A reusable soul gem. Allows you to capture any white soul.




-Treasure Mimic (Dark Souls 3) (500CP)
A large wooden “chest” divided into three compartments. The left compartment contains twenty pieces of Twinkling Titanite, the right compartment contains twenty Titanite Scales and the middle compartment contains an assorted shards and chunks of normal Titanite.
         Titanite is a good, strong metal good for weapons and armor among other things, as well as reinforcing equipment. Twinkling Titanite is handy for the reinforcement of equipment steeped in strength, baring unique abilities, without diminishing those properties, though it's somewhat poor for crafting.
         Titanite Scales are left behind by Crystal Lizards that grow to immense sizes after devouring souls, and are the ideal material for reinforcing equipment made through Soul Transposition. All three being handy materials for a blacksmith though. Titanite originating from the chest will slowly replenish over time once used for something. Theassorted normal Titanite will replenish one piece every hour or so, while the special varieties usually take a couple days per piece.
In reality, the chest is a loyal mimic that guards these resources and whatever else you put inside. If need be, it can even reveal itself to fight a would-be thief or carry out simple instructions. When walking about, two long arms and a huge tongue protrude from the inside, teeth grow along the edges of the lid and a long, lanky, deceptively powerful body stretches out of the bottom.


-Font of Power (Generic Xianxia) (600CP)
You aren't quite sure what this is supposed to be exactly, but this altar-ish looking Warehouse attachment seems to give off vast amounts of the stuff you can manipulate or feed upon. You'd never go hungry, and you could fight a great battle using just the stuff from this and not have to fuel any of it yourself. In fact, unless you were trying to fight a galaxy-destroyer or something you wouldn't have cause to draw on more stuff than this thing can provide. Maybe this is some relic of your elders?


-The Dragons Blessing (The Legend of Zelda Breath of the Wild) (600CP)
The pieces of the Spirit Dragons that wander Hyrule are truly potent, even their scales and pieces of their horn could easily take a mundane traveler’s sword up to a hero’s weapon! Their inherent magic and power is such that, for any crafting(from cooking to elixir mixing to weapon crafting to even casting enchantments) they are one of the best ingredients you can find. But the Spirit Dragons are elusive, and dangerous to harvest from. You have been gifted a small collection of Dragon parts to use at your leisure, which will replenish every fortnight.


-Crafting Materials, Supplies and Tools | Legendary Treasury (Overlord: Light Novel) (750CP)
Crafting Materials, Supplies and Tools (300CP) You have the good fortune of possessing a regenerating stock of high end crafting materials suitable across all fields of crafting, alongside the tools and workshop space in order to make something with them (you must supply the actual skill on your own however). Materials for low-end magical items (ie: Greater tier or below, as explained at the beginning of the item section) regularly resupply such that you could probably churn out hundreds of such items a day. Legacy tier materials would allow you to craft a few things a day. Materials for equipment at the Relic tier resupply often enough you could probably make a single relic tier item a day. 
Crafting Materials, Supplies and Tools+ (300CP) Your materials now include enough for a single Legendary tier piece of equipment every two weeks or so, and the materials for a single piece of Divine Tier equipment would likely take at least two months. However, there is nothing preventing you from stockpiling the materials, as they’ll keep resupplying themselves even if not used up. This may either be a warehouse attachment or attached to another property at your desire, either way it will always have enough space inside to store materials for crafting things, will always be neatly arranged, organized, and labeled, and will be perfectly capable of storing or maintaining even the most volatile or fragile of substances. Both levels of this option are discounted to those that have purchased the Crafting Class perk.
Legendary Treasury (150CP) Your guild base is famous, or perhaps infamous, for the mind boggling amount of treasure it contains within. Or it would be assuming anyone knew about it. You have enough Yggdrasil gold coins within to keep your guild base going for hundreds of years, and it is littered with powerful high tier magic items of all shapes and sizes, and an even more excessive number of low and mid tier magical items. Barring truly foolish spending habits or ruinous expenses you should likely never need to worry about your treasury running out of gold to support the guild base. In future worlds it will refill with equivalent amounts of gold, and new magic items suitable for the world it finds itself in. Additionally, and finally, it is now of arbitrary internal size. There will always be more room and more space to add in any treasures or items you come across, as the treasury will expand to fit them as you add them inside. If you or a Companion also purchased the Crafting Materials, Supplies, and Tools item from the regular Overlord (the series) jump document then this Legendary Treasury will also be filled with copious amounts of reagents and crafting materials, of appropriate qualities and levels for whatever version of the Crafting Materials, Supplies, and Tools option you purchased. In future worlds it will fill up with more as appropriate to the world(s) you’ve been to.




-Caloric Stone (Overlord: Light novel) (800CP)
The actual origin or source of the Caloric Stone is a near total mystery. It forms only from large concentrations of the Seven Prismatic Ores, legendary divine materials that possess qualities far and away above anything else. Why this occurs, or even who first discovered the Caloric Stone, is unknown. 
While held the Caloric Stone grants the usual benefits of a World Item upon its bearer, providing protections against negative status, instant death, being trapped or held, scryed upon, and so forth, trumping even the effects of other World Items. However, while useful, those are far and away the least impressive aspects of the stone. The truth of the matter is quite simple; the Caloric Stone is the ultimate crafting material. No matter what you are making, no matter how mighty, no matter what other materials are included, adding the Caloric Stone will make that item or bit of craftsmanship better.
Food, drink, weapons, armor, buildings, vehicles, golems, indeed anything that can be crafted can be quantifiably made superior (by an astounding degree) by the inclusion of the Caloric Stone in its creation process, as the stone expands the possibilities and power of what can be done with crafting. If you were to use particularly mighty materials in the creation of something, say ingredients on par with those usually used in the making of a Divine Tier item, the resulting piece of equipment would be truly legendary, halfway between the status of a Divine tier item and a World Item. Obviously, and unfortunately, the stone is expended when used.
However, since you’re paying at a premium, you are guaranteed to receive a new Caloric Stone exactly one month after using it, appearing in whatever location is most convenient for you. You may explicitly hand this to other people but you need not fear losing it. If separated from your person in a fashion you didn’t intend it will appear in the closest convenient location for you a day later. However if it was used in this time frame to make something then you must still wait a month for it to respawn. The Caloric Stone is discounted for those that purchased the 600 CP option for Crafting Materials, Supplies, and Tools. The Caloric Stone is utterly unique, and cannot be duplicated or copied via any method whatsoever using in-jump methods.


-Divine Metals (Marvel Magic) (800CP)
You have somehow managed to procure a supply of two divine ores. You now have access to 100 gallons of either Uru or Adamantine in a liquid state.


-Golden Soul Pearl Bank (Coiling Dragon) (800CP)
Golden Soul Pearls are small pearls each filled with the Soul Essence of countless people (20 million in fact), strengthening one’s soul by a truly incredible amount, allowing their soul to be at the peak of their tier of power (God Highgod). The stronger the soul, the faster the insights into the profound mysteries. This item is a small box which appears in your warehouse that can hold up to 10 Golden Soul Pearls. Refills once every ten years. Comes with the peace of mind from knowing you didn’t slaughter one hundred million people.


----------------

Magical Large Scale Supplies 
Items that are large scale for resources, such a magical greenhouse or a mine with magical metals.




-Holy Stone (Everyone Else is a Returnee) (200CP)
This is stone infused with large quantities of holy energy, meaning it is extremely full of mana as well as incredibly durable. It is in this way that the holy stone can then be used in any number of ways. Due to the holy properties, it is particularly good for use in the equipment of priests or paladins. Similarly, due to its natural strength it is good for the construction of buildings and structures. You receive several tons of high tier holy stone, enough to make a small house. Any used stone is refilled each month.


-Guild linked World item (Overlord Guild Base Suppliment) (200CP)
The Great Tomb of Nazarick contains the Throne of Kings, a World Item (and the throne in the throne room) that protects the entirety of the guild base against all attempts at scrying or anti-scrying attacks, and that further generates a small amount of Yggdrasil gold coins any time someone within would be subjected to such, alongside several other effects. Your guild base also possesses a World Item of similar potency integrated into it, and you may purchase this option multiple times.
Maybe you possess the Rainbow Bridge, which forbids all hostile forms of spatial manipulation within the guild base, while simultaneously providing unparalleled mobility to your own forces that pass through it, allowing them to quickly appear across any distance and even breach dimensional borders, and allowing them to quickly return once finished with whatever task they were set.
Perhaps instead your guild base contains within it the Garden of Eden, a place said to contain at least a single copy of every plant (or plant like thing) in the entire world, and often many many times more than that for more common things, regrowing within a day anything that is taken. To say nothing of the mighty plant-based creatures that spawn from it that will help to defend your guild base, or how you could harvest from it constantly to feed an immense population.
Or perhaps instead your guild base possesses an entrance to the legendary Agartha, a subterranean city long abandoned but filled with such mineral wealth that it could be mined forever, with an ore vein for every type of metal or precious stone one could imagine no matter how rare that replenish a mere day after excavation.
If those don’t tickle your interest, perhaps you will find the Scholomance to be to your liking? A school of dark and forbidden magic, filled with the knowledge of every spell imaginable, and that allows unparalleled control and manipulation of the weather and empowers the magic of all rightful inhabitants of the Guild Base while they are inside.
Or maybe none of these things appeal, and you have a different idea in mind? So long as it is not one of The Twenty (ie: expendable 1-time effects), and so long as it remains entirely tied to the Guild Base itself, you may instead come up with your own World Item, with appropriate effects to apply to your base. In such cases, fanwank as appropriate.
* Should probably list the guild linked items chosen, which would be the Garden of Eden, and the Agartha


-Field of Heart-Shaped Herbs (MCU2) (300CP)
Out of all the Wakandan secrets that lie within the borders of the reclusive city, this one is the most potent secret of them all. It is also the most dangerous. It is a small but potent field, its soil infused with radiation from the ancient Vibranium meteor when it fell to such an extent that it would affect any plant life growing within it, like these herbs. The herbs are taken and ground up so that it may be imbibed, and when the imbiber is buried under a light covering they will find themselves on a spiritual journey to talk with their ancestors... and then rise a greater warrior. Strength and speed that reaches the lower levels of superhuman, durability to survive explosions with minor injuries. Perfect coordination and balance with agility that far outstrips Olympic athletes. It would not be too farfetched to say that the results of this herb match even the ones derived from the Super Soldier formula that made Captain America... and now you have a small field of these plants. Be very careful. After you leave, this can either be a property or a Warehouse Attachment.


-Tenebrium​ ​Mine​ (Divinity - Original Sin)​ (600CP)
Tenebrium is an utterly useful material, for all that it is also incredibly dangerous to handle. Still, considering all its uses, one can hardly be blamed for desiring to have a steady supply of the crystal on hand. The Tenebrium Mine attaches directly to your Cosmic Warehouse and takes the form of a traditional mining tunnel about a hundred feet deep. Inside one will find a few dozen crystals of Tenebrium growing, each large enough to produce a single ingot when smelted. Once harvested new crystals will slowly grow in their place over the course of a week. The mine is also capable of producing other metals, crystals, and even gemstones if given a sample of such material. These will form in veins along the walls of the tunnel, but grow much more slowly. Exotic metals will form at a rate of one ingot every two weeks and crystals will produce roughly the same amount. Gemstones seem to be easier and the mine will produce a collection of small stones that will fill a cupped hand in a week. Normal metals, like gold and silver, can also be produced at a rate of one ingot per week. An ingot here refers to enough material to forge a traditional longsword with.


-Dust (The Games We Play) (400CP)
Ah yes. Where would we be without this? This is a supply of Dust of all types, presented to you weekly for whatever purposes you may have for it.
Dust being a crystallised form of elemental energy, color changing depending on what it’s elemental affinity is. It can be used for a variety of things, be it adding some Aura to make them explode into a burst of their native energy or sewing it into clothing to make empowered wear, putting it in bullets to create specialty ammunition of great strength or just to power technology. Types seen thus far are water, air, lightning, fire, gravity, time and Light, but there are many other kinds. 
For 100 CP it’s a fairly small supply. More than enough for a family, even the most wasteful or extravagant one or businessmen or Hunters or any other. Let’s say several kilograms of each type. 
For 200 CP it’s a larger supply, many tons upon tons of it, enough to keep a small city functioning pretty easily, or keep a small army supplied. Emphasis on the ‘small’, mind you.
Of course, you could pay 400CP instead and forget all these constraints. You now own a whole deposit of dust, one with nigh-endless supplies of all types. But of course, once again, the keyword is ‘nigh’. Or you could have a set of literally bottomless containers, but where’s the fun in that?


-Greenhouse Three (Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality) (400CP)
​Or any other number you like, really. This greenhouse, either inserted into new worlds in a location of your choosing or attached to your Warehouse, is perfect for growing all manner of magical plants. So perfect, in fact, that it can grow new ones! In addition to several rows of plots and potted plants of all kinds, it contains four larger plots; one at each corner, suitable for one large tree apiece. Planting any kind of magical raw material, such as Re’em blood or unicorn hair, makes a tree that grows that material. Liquid materials are stored in hard, coconut-like fruits on the tree, easily broken with concerted effort but highly unlikely to spill, split, or otherwise damage the surrounding plant life no matter ​how ​volatile your reagent is. Since it’s a magically expanded greenhouse with ​literally every species of plant life in it, ​it also has a bit of magic so that all you need to do is think of what you need and start walking down a row, and you’ll reach it within seven paces. All plants within this greenhouse are automatically cared for and reach maturity within a maximum of one week. Plants are kept docile by the greenhouse’s magic, so don’t worry about the Venomous Tentacula eating one of your ears while you’re not looking. Doesn’t automatically update in future jumps, but you can bring new plants into it manually and incorporate them into the greenhouse by planting them in the provided pots. A must-have for aspiring Potions masters.


-Gold Market (World Seed) (400CP)
Welcome to the Gold Market! As this is your first time as a customer, let me take this moment to explain. By going to any temple or altar to the Gods, offering one gold coin, and praying for the market to appear, anyone can gain access to it. Though in your case, you’ll simply need to think about it for the market to appear in its entirety in your mind, and can browse it at your leisure without having to pay any fees. 
From there, you can buy anything, as long as you can pay the price, though the price is inflated just a tad, such as Seeds of Water normally costing 1 silver going for 20 instead, and something incredibly rare like a Seed of Time costing half a million gold. Incredibly powerful items made by the Gods and normally only accessible through completing quests might even be priced at billions of gold. But this cost is worth it, as there really is literally anything available: items, hints on how to advance your abilities, skills and abilities themselves in their entirety, NPCs (artificial entities created by the system) of any level, whether you want to lease them or buy them outright, information, or animals and monsters. Even things of questionable usefulness can be found here, such as the sex tapes of the Gods ("Goddess of Breasts VS. Goddess of Beauty, Beach Edition, Interactive"), or the abilities to always sense the time of the day and to guess how many hairs there are on a creature. And if you had, say, a decillion gold and sacrificed the population of a planet, you could even buy yourself into Godhood. 
The wares available in the Gold Market will include ones from both worlds you have visited in the past, and worlds you will travel to in the future, so that its slogan of offering truly anything actually holds true for you, though the same price markup still applies. It’ll also accept any currency you might have on you, instead of only recognizing the gold coins used in the system. And since you’re a VIP, you can even sell things to the market, though you’ll only get their normal prices for them instead of the marked up ones.


-Trade Goods (Youjo Senki) (400CP)
How about an investment to kickstart your business? You now own a handful of warehouses full to the brim with coal, iron, lumber, cloth, and various other materials. While not immediately useful, the local government will really need these if they end up going to war. Alternately, use it yourself for something.Refills at the end of each week. 


-Metal of the Gods (Death mage doesn’t want a fourth time) (400CP)
Adamantite. Mythril. Orichalcum. Magical metals of incredible power. Adamantite and Mythril are opposites, in a way. The first, incredibly sturdy, the perfect material to defend against the physical world. Mythril, on the other had, has anti-magic effects, defending against spells just as well as Adamantite does against physical blows, while also being capable of damaging spirits. Finally, there is Orichalcum, the metal of the Gods, having resistance against both physical and magical blows even greater than the other two. The metals of Gods, which are now at your hands. You have a replenishing supply of each material, enough to forge from their raw forms an entire suit of plate armor, a shield, a spear, and a sword. This supply, should it be used or sold, will replenish once every year, though it should be noted that those with the ability to forge from these great metals is far and few between. Post jump, you will also receive an equal supply of any other metals considered divine alongside the ones provided here from any setting’s visited, including those created by you or others.


-Herb Garden (Azeroth) (400CP)
 A herb garden designed however you wish. At the basic level this garden has all the herbs found on Earth and in Classic WoW. For additional purchases of 50 CP you can add the herbs of the next expansions in chronological order. BC - WotLK - Cata - MoP - WoD - Legion - BfA. Herbs picked here will not need to be replanted and will regrow on their own without any help from you. There will always be enough herbs for whatever you may need them for, but if you pick more than 100 herbs within a month they will need time to rest before they regrow taking one month to do so. You can attach this to your warehouse, a pocket dimension, or import it into the world of Future Jumps.


-Qian Yuan’s Treasure Vault (Talisman Emperor-Mortal Dimension) (400CP)
Chen Xi encountered a treasure vault much like this one in the Oceanic Desert. While he had to fight several cultivators to get away with the treasure, you’ll have an easier time, as this vault attaches to your Warehouse or inserts into jumps in a location only known to you (you may make this choice for each jump). The Vault contains 4,096 doors, and behind each door is a space containing a particular item: medicinal pills suitable to aid in cultivation or to recharge Essence during battle, piles of rare materials like White Refined Gold, Water Netherstone, Six-Yang Crimson Iron, Azure Heart Wood, suitable for equipment refinement and alchemy, gardens filled with varieties of spirit herbs and flowers… in effect, if it’s a material used to craft something, it can probably be found here. The materials slowly replenish themselves so long as they aren’t completely used up (and there is no material which is singular - you cannot completely use up a material unless you are in a hurry to craft something big), and you can add materials from future jumps to the vault to have them gain the same benefit.


-Quintessence Fountain (Exalted - The Sidereals) (400CP)
This large jade fountain will be installed in your warehouse. Every time someone offers a prayer with no other place to go, one that there is no other spirit who will hear, it will be drawn to the fountain and become a droplet of the shining liquid called Quintessence. When someone prays to you or one of your companions, it will instead merge together with other such prayers to eventually form a rainbow colored block of Ambrosia that floats in the fountain. A quick prayer to the fountain will summon craftsgods to fashion whatever mundane material or object you wish from these substances. Things made from Quintessence will be wondrous but temporary, food that will disappear if not eaten or clothes that will fade to nothing after a month. Objects made from Ambrosia will be permanent and can include Jade or, unlike regular Ambrosia, Starmetal. Another fountain (or even several, if the property is big enough) will appear on each other area that you take with you between worlds.


-The Mine | Burning Crusade Mine | Wrath of the Lich King Mine | Cataclysm Mine (Azeroth) (550CP)
The Mine (400CP) As the name suggests, this is a mine. It contains basic metals that you can find in Classic WoW (copper, tin, silver, iron, gold, mithril, thorium, truesilver, and dark iron).  Your mine will grow in size adding additional floors representing the different expansions for each additional purchase beyond this level. The mine will never run dry, but it can be depleted if you gather the ore too quickly. Give the mine a month and it’ll be back up to full capacity. You can place this mine anywhere in future Jumps that you wish or within your own pocket dimension, if you have one.
Burning Crusade Mine (50CP) You also gain access to all metals found in Burning Crusade (fel iron, adamantite, eternium, and khorium). 
Wrath of the Lich King Mine (50CP) You also gain access to all metals within Wrath of the Lich King (cobalt, saronite, and titanium).
Cataclysm Mine (50CP) You also gain access to raw ores from Cataclysm (obsidium, elementium, and pyrite).


-Alchemical Haven (Desolate Era I) (600CP)
This is a plot of land about three hundred and fifty thousand square miles large that would keep getting bigger to accommodate additional plants, accessible through a door in your warehouse. Inside this dimension, you will find soil that adapts itself to grow whatever is planted in it, and an atmosphere that will change itself to meet the demands of each and every plant as needed, transforming some areas into barren, frozen wastelands, and others into fiery hellholes. To add to this, the Alchemical Haven automatically harvests fruits and replants seeds, meaning that the only intervention needed for it to stay operational is the introduction of new seeds. It can even speed up time for some plants so that they can be planted and harvested as much as you wish. However, this only works when there are no sentient beings within the dimension. Before you plant anything, there are several mortal ranked fruits and spiritual grasses already planted and matured for you to use that altogether may allow you to enter the Zifu stage, if you already possess the required insights.
* This items time acceleration component is unique among plant growth garden items


-Mithril Mines and Armory (Lord of the Rings Twilight of the North) (600CP)
There may be older and fouler things than Orcs in the deep places of the world, but there are great treasures and opportunities to be found in those places as well. Dwarven miners know this, and the lure of mithril often proves irresistible. With this, you need not worry about the presence of any Balrog or Orcs, as your veins of mithril shall lie within a mine dropped into a location near to where you start or even just connected to your Warehouse. The great quantities of mithril that these mines make available allow Dwarf-smiths, should you have invited any, to craft marvellously strong and light armor for your warriors or yourself. More than simply a store-room and workshop for Dwarven smiths, a Mithril Armory is capable of outfitting an entire host in the most supple and strong metal known in Middle-earth. The presence of such materials naturally attracts the finest Dwarvensmiths, who may also turn their efforts to forging superior weapons in addition to crafting mithril armor. Armored and armed in shining mithril and dwarf-make weapons, your forces are certain to be fearsome indeed on the battlefield. In future jumps, you will attract whatever setting equivalent to the Dwarves there happens to be. To find work in your armory and lands.


-Let there be Light (The Games We Play) (600CP)
And so there is. This is a replenishing supply of neutral Sephirot components of all ten kinds, for all your soul crafting needs without the horribly unethical gathering process and terrible guilt.
You get 1000 people’s worth of pure, high quality Sephirot, the stuff souls are made of. It’s so high quality that each is worth a hundred of your average souls, if not more. Don’t worry about losing any unused stuff either, because it builds up as time goes on. Sephirot is some of the most valuable stuff in the world here, and that’s for a reason.
In this world, the ratio of Sephirot within your soul determines its structure, the power of your Semblance and other such things. In future worlds, it could be entirely different, luckily enough you get the local stuff no matter where you go, allowing you to keep up your tinkering. And again, don’t worry about losing access to any of the past stuff. Each setting’s soul stuff will continue to produce itself separately from a separate setting.
But what use does it have in the future? Depends on where you go and how it all works there, but you’ll have to figure that yourself for the most part. Maybe you can eat it.


-Go To Hel (Kamen Rider Gaim) (600CP)
It would appear you have happened across an oddly fertile patch of Helheim. Any seeds you plant here will grow into Helheim plants that produce Lockseeds of the source of the seeds. You could even try crossbreeding the resulting plants to create Lockseeds that grant armaments based on a mix of the two donor plants. While this can get you some very potent Lockseeds, keep in mind it won't necessarily scale directly with the fruits, and something on the level of the Forbidden Fruit would take ages of effort and many unusual fruits to even begin to approach it. After the jump, this patch becomes attached to your Warehouse, giving you a stable Helheim patch free of Invess except any you make.


-Supreme Emerald Spirit Garden (Against the Gods!) (600CP)
This is a garden worthy of being in legends, Jumper. A vast expanse of earth richly covered with grass, located in either an attachment to your warehouse, one of your other pocket dimensions or on a real world spot of your choice, this has exactly as much space as needed for its purposes. Which are twofold. 
Firstly, it has prime, finest-quality samples of every single herb, flower etc in existence. It doesn’t matter how rare or valuable they are, you can find at least one of every one, and potentially many more. Plants breed and spread at rates proportional to their rarity and rates of breeding in the outside world. Something like the Emperor Awakening Heart Lotus, a plant normally found once in centuries or millennia, takes a full year to bloom, and others take proportionately lesser time.
In future jumps the garden won’t acquire any plants that are absolutely unique, like Yggdrasil in Norse Myth, but everything else is fair game, even divine or mythical plants of all types. And as for those plants, you need to find a seed and sow them here, at which point they become as any other plants. 
Additionally, this garden has the property of ‘adapting’ any plants seeded here to the local settings. That is, a fruit that provides ki or magical energy in its original world would provide Profound Energy in this one, and the equivalent in future settings. They retain the ability to provide any previous ‘versions’ at your will.


-Mineral caverns (Trinity:Aberrant) (600CP) 
A sprawling network of natural caverns that you have expanded on, these tunnels are surprisingly cozy. There's about as much space in the caverns as a large shopping mall, and you can rearrange things to your liking. You'll also need to install amenities yourself, the caverns begin with nothing but bare stone walls. Changes you make inside are retained, and you can choose to have appropriate properties attached to the caverns at the beginning of each jump. The main appeal of these caverns is that unusual mineral formations occlude any energy emissions, from inside or outside. Sensors, super-senses, magic and 'other' will register the caverns as an area of undisturbed rock, no matter who or what is inside.


-Heavenly Azure Profound Jungle (Against the Gods!) (600CP)
Pills, pellets and crystals are a cornerstone of cultivation. Even one or two powerful pills can redefine the fates of entire clans or sects, as it so happens. Equally important, however, are Profound Beasts, or rather their bodies. There is the blood, which is a great tool in cultivation, the flesh and bones, used for their own purposes, but the most special are the Profound Cores found within these beasts that make life in so many parts of these worlds so difficult.
You have something completely amazing, in that regard. This is a dense jungle, attached to your warehouse, filled with all sorts of dangerous profound beasts. As a matter of fact, it has one of every single species and race of Profound Beasts in this setting, all ready and waiting for you. Because you see, while the blood, flesh, bones, core and everything of these beasts is at the level they’re supposed to be, their actual fighting abilities are dramatically lower. Three entire realms lower, as a matter of fact. That is, the Emperor level monsters can only do damage on the level of a True Realm monster, and so on. Unless you want them at full power for some reason, that is, Then they are.
This doesn’t apply to beasts below the Sky Profound Realm, so the weakest any of them get is to Elementary. Also, each Realm monsters are isolated in their own 'zone’ of the Jungle they practically never leave, with the weakest ones on the outermost circle and so on. The numbers of the beasts inside are proportional to how rare they are in the outside world, as is the rate of replenishment if killed. Even the rarest beasts only take a few months, though, maybe a full year for the absolute rarest of them.
In future worlds, the Jungle provides beasts from the local setting too.


-Natural Regeneration (World Seed) (600CP)
In Neolife, it wouldn’t be wrong to say that magic is in everything. One interesting facet of this can be seen in how on many worlds, dug earth and other natural resources are replaced by the ambient mana over the course of a few weeks if there isn’t anything like a support structure preventing it. While this is certainly convenient, you thought to yourself, “I can do better”. After all, many important resources can’t even be found on planets, like mana gems or the insanely rare mineral osmium, which are only found on asteroids. But with the ability you created, this won’t be a problem anymore, because you can just restore them anyway: simply by spending enough mana, it is possible for you to regenerate any natural resource or duplicate existing ones. 
You could pump mana into an asteroid to restore whatever it is that was mined there to get effectively infinite resources out of it, do the same to the extremely valuable gem lying in front of you to get multiple copies of it, or send out a massive wave of mana to cover a whole planet in a forest. The mana required scales linearly with the amount of the resource you want to work with, its complexity, and its power. So while you could easily get massive amounts of diamonds and wood even with a little mana, duplicating something like the Top 5 metals (see Notes) or similar materials would require truly insane amounts of mana.


-Shadow Economy|Discreet Purchaser (Lords of the Night - Liches) (300CP)
Shadow Economy (150CP) You have a lot of wealth hidden...somewhere.  This perk takes care of expenses as if a level twenty expert was diverting his income to paying for you (on average, 880,000 gold or $12,000,000 per year). In good times, this can cover more, and in bad times, less. 
Discreet Purchaser (150CP) There are many things you might want and need that are...annoying to get. Maybe for legal reasons, maybe because no one buys that much gold, or the world you’re on doesn’t have magic scrolls. You can collect (all or part of) your Shadow Economy income in goods, but you pay double the normal price. These goods don’t have to be goods available in your current world or things you can legally get. They discreetly show up when you need them, even if getting them should take a long time or involve some kind of commission. These goods can be improvements to your properties, installations, constructions, or upgrades, but no other kind of service.


-Collector(Fate/Legends Oasis Fantasy) (800CP)
Gold as far as the eye can see. A endless sea of treasures, like an desert where every dune is a mound containing the legends of a hundred different tales. Before you is a great golden portal in the air, within which these endless treasures constantly shift and swirl before you. It is like a Gate, one that leads to the source of so much wonder. All that you can see is now yours and it is even more valuable than you might think at first.
The power you now possess is to be the Collector of all of Humanity’s creations. Every invention, every making, every forging, every last creation that mankind has created, is creating or will create is found within this endless vault of space. However, this only applies to singular creations. Any mundane and magical weapon or vehicle or potion or book or armour or anything else in that vein can be found present in here. However, outright locations cannot be found. While one may find the individual buildings in a city or collective fortress, they would not find the city itself. Nor will the vault contain things that are merely slight alterations to non-human objects. A mountain that has a castle on it or a stone stuck to a stick. Mankind has created a great many things but for it to apply to our vault’s contents, it must be wholly a creation of man. A metal blade might be made from natural materials but it has been shaped and altered thoroughly through human processes. A last note on the contents of the vault, is that anything retained within it will not be harmful, even if it normally should be, to the owner of the vault while within this space and that you are able to use anything within this space, regardless of the normal conditions some magical items may have for their users.
You can summon the vault’s portals with a few moments concentration or through the turning of one of several golden keys from within this vault that you can obtain. These portals can be made anywhere within your sight range, even should you not be looking where you form them at the moment, and are very quick to open. While you do not know the exact nature or presence of everything within the dimensional space, you can instantly call anything from the vault to your person as you wish and search within it for anything that fits any kind of specifications you have in mind. With just a thought, you can even organise the space and it’s contents however you might choose. Setting it up as a great golden museum instead of the endless desert of treasure, for example.
Once you have opened the portal to your vault once, you can freely continue to open them at an incredible pace within your range, even dozens at once or enormous portals through which an entire castle could pass. Through these portals, you can bring forth anything within your vault, no matter how large or how far in. You may also choose to fire out things from within the vault, with the maximum speed that you can do so rising with your magical power. Even at a base level however, you can fire the smaller objects within at the speed of sound. Anything that exits the vault can be instantly retrieved with just a thought, replacing it within the vault due to the effects of an artefact. Due to the same magical item within the vault, anything that is sourced from the vault originally will slowly repair or, if destroyed, reappear entirely within the vault over the course of a few days. Items made for single uses however will not repair or reappear. The final and perhaps most notable attribute of this quality of yours is that your vault has not ceased growing. While the space only draws from this current timeline and world, as you travel to new worlds or timelines, you will find that the space you have access to will fill itself with all the achievements of humanity from each new world and timeline at an instant.

Mundane Databases 



-Strange Formula|Nitrimine (MCU) (200CP) 
Strange Formula (100CP): This chemical formula is the brainchild of the German scientist Dr. Erskine, and is directly responsible for the creation of Captain America. As is, this is only the formula, and you must make it yourself... but as a result it could possibly let you modify the serum for other uses. Beware its tendencies to amplify the personality traits of the user, or be prepared to find a way to fix that fact.
Nitrimine (100CP): The formula for the chemical compound known as Nitramene, this compound has multiple purposes. A typical Nitramene bomb has a blast radius of five hundred yards after which it creates a vacuum that causes an implosion as matter rushes to fill the void that it has created, but a grenade of that size will do considerably less damage. On the other hand, Nitramene also emits low levels of Vita Radiation, which has a specific wavelength that has stabilizing properties.


-0-D for Dummies (Megas XLR) (200CP) 
A set of textbooks that explains the basic of Hyper-dimensional structure, most potent in making spaces with overlapping existences in layman terms, use tech in making spaces and parts that don't exist in real space. Warning! Extremely energy intensive.


-Technical Schematics (Warhammer 40k: tau empire) (200CP) 
This small database is a well organized, easily searchable, and easily accessible list of detailed schematics and scientific texts covering all machines, tools, and sciences understood by the T’au. It cannot be remotely hacked or externally corrupted by others. During your jump, this database includes all T’au knowledge up to either current 40k canon or all information that would be available to the T’au within  the next hundred years without your interference, whichever option includes less advanced technology. After this jump, the schematics are upgraded to include all designs and science your T’au have developed and all designs and science developed in canon by the T’au by the end of the Fifth Sphere Expansion.


-Vitrium notes (Trinity: Aberrant) (200CP) 
A synthetic crystal that can be spun and blown like glass while being mechanically as strong as steel at a quarter of the weight, colored or transparent as desired. But every object made of Vitrium has a unique resonant frequency that if hit at sufficient intensity will cause it to shatter like a crystal wineglass. Perhaps these notes discarded by Vitrium's creator can help you perfect the material?


-CRAFT Mind Files (Limitless) (200CP)
You have copies of mind files from all the leading minds of CRAFT, complete with uncanny valley-esque holographic heads, informationally replicating their knowledge. These can never be stolen or corrupted, and each jump you can receive additional mind files and holographic heads for the premier scientists of the jump. Just keep in mind that the software running them does a middling poor job of replicating personalities.


-N-Ways Fusion Plant (Endless Space) (200CP)
Refueling? What’s that? You have mastered the art of Endless power generation, and any device you possess or can claim as yours never runs out of power. Other things can still be a problem, like weapons overheating, engines breaking down, etc, but you never need to worry about your battery running out. Your starting equipment and ship already have fusion plants installed in them, and you have schematics to make more, of various sizes, but you will need some rare elements and facilities to make them. The smaller they are, the simpler it is. Making a capital ship reactor is going to take a LOT of materials, but is totally worth it.


-Extremis Formula (MCU) (200CP)
Another attempt at creating super soldiers, this formula creates a virus that can enhance a person to superhuman strength, reflexes, and endurance. Additionally, normal Extremis users gain the ability to generate extreme amounts of heat through a complex metabolic process, generating heat from their bodies up to several thousand degrees Celsius on any part of the body they desire. When regenerating body parts, the wounds take on the appearance of burning ashes while growing back the lost body part, in a matter of minutes, and cooling into regular skin, flesh, and bone. Be wary however, as this makes you light up on thermal sensors, and should your body heat up too much, you may end up exploding. Keep this in mind.




-Primordial Schematics (Necron Jump – SB Edition 1.0) (200CP)
The human world of Cadia was able to stymie the advance of Chaos largely due to the efforts of Necron technology. The mysterious pylons of Cadia acted to reinforce the materium even on the verge of the Eye of Terror. During the Thirteenth Black Crusade, the Archmagos Belisarius Cawl was even able to use them to shrink the largest Warp Storm in the galaxy. The designs behind this priceless technology are now within your possession. Outside of this setting, pylons designed according to the specifications of these schematics will disrupt interdimensional portals and incursions with some fine-tuning. 


-Ancient Knowledge Database (Stargate Atlantis) (200CP)
Not interested in buying a Lantean City Ship or infiltrating Atlantis itself to get your hands on all that wonderful science? This small server farm (the size of an olympic swimming pool) will be placed in your Cosmic Warehouse or other property of your choice with the appropriate power and network hookups. Don’t expect to start churning out ZPMs just by buying this; first you’ll have to sift through what is basically the Ancient scientific equivalent of our Internet - only instead of being a few mere decades worth of information produced by a people who’ve barely gotten off their first rock, this database holds tens of thousands of years of information collected by an entire intergalactic civilisation.


-The Codex (Uber) (300CP) 
The entirety of the mysterious work of unknown origin that enabled Project U in the first place. To this date only a minor portion has been deciphered. The first chapter does provide instructions to decoding the rest based on universal mathematical principles. After that it consists of three main sections. The first contains instructions to produce the catalyst, the second describes a possible way to locate people susceptible to the upgrade process and has as of yet been untranslated, the third details the separate ways of upgrading humans. Even with the instructions provided the confusing manner passages are structured, combined with the interwoven philosophical treatises and the fact that there seem to be thousands of ways to decode the passages to slightly different results it will take months to decipher a single passage of a relevant length. This item does not come with the already translated passages.


-RobCo Holotapes (Fallout 4) (300CP)
A series of Holotapes detailing the blueprints for numerous Robco projects, including Protectrons, Assaultrons, Securitrons, and the various models of Pip-Boys. There’s even a group of Holotapes detailing Liberty Prime’s systems and construction. These Holotapes seem to be more advanced than the standard kind, and therefore there are only a few rather than the hundreds this amount of information would normally take up.


-Animate Library (Bablovia) (400CP)
A living library containing all sorts of Bablovian wisdom and science. The library is a loyal servant which obeys your every command. It gets stronger with every book in it, but will never be get stronger than you are. The spirit animating the library can transported to any library or collection of books you own.


-Factorio database (Factorio) (400CP)
A bulky data storage device containing the blueprints and software needed to construct and run all of Factorio's machines, weapons, buildings, and vehicles.


-Recipe codex (Unmodded Minecraft) (400CP)
Summoned to hand or dismissed with a thought, this book records every Minecraft recipe that exists within the game. Post-jump, the book will update with every blueprint, chemical process or recipe you create or learn. Whenever you lay hands on a new type of material, the book will update itself with a detailed analysis of its mechanical properties. While the book only records what you know and cannot create new designs, it can extrapolate from existing knowledge and make suggestions when you need to make modifications or substitutions to existing blueprints.


-The Art and Science (Draka Series) (400CP)
You now have a complete technical database of every scientific and technological development that has been produced by either the Alliance or the Domination, all the way up to the interstellar era of ‘Drakon’. This database will update in future jumps to add in a complete archive of all local technology or magic, up to the latest time period available for the Jumper to insertinton. As a convenience feature, the database has an intuitive search engine that makes finding anything you’re looking for a snap.


-Perfect Body (Andromeda) (400CP) 
You are in possession of a fully functioning and programmed to your specifications android body with appearance to your liking. This is more “Sturdy” than a standard avatar, it has been built with the best Vedran technology. Built to survive the horrors of the post Commonwealth society, and with blueprints to make more. This body can be upgraded if you know how and keeps upgrades in-between jumps. You can choose for this to be used as a free android companion.


-Archive (Artemis Fowl) (400CP)
Whoa, access to the Council’s black archives! Well, not exactly, but close. This is a digital archive in your possession, and what it holds is… technology. That is, all of it. Every single piece of technology, from the wheel onwards to the most advanced stuff under the earth, has it’s schematics, developer’s notes and
blueprints stored here, explained clearly and obviously enough that simply following the instructions would let someone built it all up.
There is everything here, from the People’s works to Humanity’s designs. Every program ever written, every microchip ever designed, the whole sum total of human and fairy technical knowledge. In future worlds too, it updates to hold the same level of detail on the local technology, everything ever crafted in the world.


-Biotransference Protocols (Necron Jump – SB Edition 1.0) (400CP)
Behold, the designs that were meant to secure the salvation of the Necrontyr, and instead cost them their souls. These schematics contain two things of note: the first is the Necrodermis shells of the Necrons and their constructs, from the lowliest Warriors and Scarabs to the greatest Tomb Sentinels. Secondly, they teach the method of biotransference itself, transitioning an organic mind into a body of metal. Will you use these designs to create a robotic army to put the Men of Iron to shame? Or will you use them to secure immortality? 


-Professor T.O. Morrow’s Notes (Young Justice) (400CP)
These notes detail the creation of the “Red” series of androids, including Red Torpedo, Red Inferno, Red Tornado, and Red Volcano, as well as designs for androids that resemble actual people.


-Sentinel Plans (X-Men Evolution) (400CP)
How on earth did you get these? The prototype isn’t meant to be finished until almost a year passes. Regardless these are Bolivar Task’s plans to even out the mutant playing field with a mass producible robot. The sentinel as it is called is capable of many things ranging from firing lasers, flight to the atmosphere, and has a gel substance which will trap most mutants. It seems like there are even plans for something called a Super Sentinel but with current technology its almost impossible to complete. Maybe you’ll be the first to bring it in then.


-Leonardo da Vinci’s Journal (Genius the Transgression) (400CP)
An artifact from the time now known as the Renaissance, these works of a man who was part of one of the great movements of humanities Mania can be seen evidenced in everything around the modern era, however the most well known by far is those artifacts crafted, drawn, drafted, and painted by one Leonardo da Vinci. He was not the greatest of his age in anything singular but his ideas are the stuff of modern legend and looking at the devices he worked on one could see the raw, unrefined principles he was working with. 
This journal is a work akin to that great man’s works which explains all the internally consistent ideas of your Aesthetic, written in a way that the journal contains the element of Leonardo’s genius that allowed him to translate his ideas to others so well. By reading this journal anyone, even a Mere Mortal, would treat the Aesthetic in question as if it were normal science, ‘getting around’ the worst Havok. If you somehow have (Not so) Consistent Technology you instead have a single Journal per Aesthetic you’ve used, in a trunk that always seems to have enough room inside it just one more Journal, no matter the number already within, however the person affected by this item must read it through, not memorize it but at least once cover to cover, in order for the benefits to kick.


-Computation Technologies (Generic Cyberpunk) (400CP) 
An Artificial intelligence isn’t constrained by the need for food or water, but by the need for power and processors. You have in your possession the designs and documentation for computing technologies that are the peak of what a world like this can offer. Easily scale-able to whatever your needs or desires are, produced for either general or specialized uses, these are easily adapted to handle whatever you require and will remain applicable and top of the line for decades to the envy of others who might want technology like this. Why be limited to what the market can provide for you when you can have the best.


-'Space Is Like This Piece Of Paper…’ (Generic Space Opera) (400CP)
… you see. We three dimensional beings have to walk along its surface to get from this point on the one side  to this one on the other. This Drive however, will do this! ...Why yes I did need to stab the blueprints with a pen to get my point across what do you mean you are all scientists? - Blueprints and schematics instructing the construction, installation and maintenance of various methods of faster than light travel. Included are instructions on how to upgrade several types of those drives to be able to travel between Jumps in addition to their normal capabilities, though they require a Spark to be completed. Lastly you can fold this blueprint and stab it with a pen to make even a caveman understand the concept of wormholes. The paper will return to pristine condition the next time it is unobserved. Pen not included.


-Stark’s Blueprints (Avengers - Earth Mightiest Hero) (400CP) 
Perhaps thanks to a bit of corporate espionage, you now have blueprints for pretty much everything that Tony Stark has ever built (with the exception of things built off world or with the help of others, such as the Uru armor or the Magic Nullifier). Includes his suits, his Arc Reactor technology, and the Quinjets.


-Full Storage (Modded Fallout) (400CP)
This old, half-broken Pip-Boy seems to be incapable of even starting its operating system, the diagnostics indicating that the entirety of its vast 64k RAM is already in use. Most people might simply discard it or strip it for spare parts, but a closer look will reveal the exact reason for its fault: its internal database has been crammed full of Fallout design specs, schematics, scientific principles and so on. How full, you ask? Well, it’s got just about every semi-common piece of Fallout tech in there ​somewhere​, from Laser Rifle schematics to Assaultron software and Berry Mentat formulations to Power Armor designs. Though mainly limited to the kind of technologies one could have found in the Pre-War world of old, a number of designs that were only finalized in the two centuries following the apocalypse can also be found here (such as the Hydra drug, the Enclave’s X-01 and Hellfire armor designs, and the Radium Rifle). Though you’ll still need a way to actually ​build​ all of these things, this database is nonetheless one of the most spectacular treasures scavvers could find.


-Wraith Data Device (Stargate Atlantis) (400CP)
A Wraith data storage device, with an adaptor for human computers. It contains everything you ever wanted to know about Wraith technology but were too afraid to ask. The sheer volume of data deals more with theory rather than engineering practice (eg: you might find the technical explanation on how the Wraith beaming tech works, but not the schematics to build one straight away) 


-Capsule Calamity (Dragon Ball) (400CP)
This is a patented prize of the Capsule Corporation, able to store incredibly large and unwieldy objects in light, easy-to-use capsules. You now know how to make such capsules and store things up to the size of a small house in a single one. You can even ‘re-equip’ things to said capsules once you’re done using them. How handy is that? 




-Antibody Creation (Cells at Work) (400CP) 
Preparation is the key to victory, and now, you can prepare a solution to any enemy you face. A solution in the chemical sense, anyway. You now know how to synthesize a special liquid that can be attuned to a specific enemy, acting like an acid on them when they are exposed to it. You can modulate how potent of an effect it has, from dissolving away at them, to merely giving burns, to even just targeting their clothes and equipment. This liquid does take some time to make, generally around half an hour to an hour, but it can go much quicker if you have access to some DNA or other similar chemical identifiers. With time and experimentation, you may find out how to have other effects aside from just acid, such as knocking them unconscious or sealing away their abilities for a time.
Premade Solutions (w/ Lucky Defender): You now have the ability to create special ‘blank’ solutions, which are apparently unattuned to any given enemy. However, when you carry these ‘blank’ solutions with you, and you get drawn in to face a surprise enemy, you’ll find that they are attuned specially to that enemy. You’ll have to make more ‘blank’ solutions afterward, as all prior made ‘blank’ solutions would have been attuned specifically to that surprise enemy.


-Engineer’s Notes: Avvenire (ARIA) (500CP)
A last set of documents that was kept in the archives. This copy seems to have been fragmented into components, though as you compile more of it together it will become evident that this details the specifics of the actual terraforming process, including the equipment and calculations involved in the process of creating Aqua. It does go to note that while the knowledge stored within this could help a new engineer tackle a different terraforming project, each planet presents its own challenges, and this information is better taken as a sample of notes rather than a hard guideline.
Each time you take this option your own abilities at controlling the logistic and engineering elements of terraforming improves slightly, though with ten purchases you’ll find that the documents will be complete – further purchases won’t help you much… unless you had a different use for them.



-PDA|Master Builder (Subnautica) (600CP) 
PDA (0CP) Loaded with an emergency intelligence and more data capacity than you could ever use, this is a survivor’s second most powerful tool (after his or her brain.) The AI may get a bit...quirky...over long deployments. Your version is basically indestructible. Contains basic construction blueprints.
Master Builder (600 CP) Your PDA gains immediate access to all the blueprints available in Subnautica, as well as a few that can’t normally be found. These unique structures are: Ultrasonic Fencing which ward away hostile wildlife; Hydrogen balloons and a submersible dock for when the hurricanes sweep through; Hydrogen-Fusion plants which produce extreme energy from seawater; and finally, a robotics bay where you can manufacture automated scavenger bots.


-IS Lab (Infinite Stratos) (600CP)
A state of the art and top secret laboratory cross manufactorum of your very own. While this can certainly accomplish a wide variety of uses as either a lab or a customisable factory to mass produce machines, it’s true worth lies in the detailed Infinite Stratos blueprints and instructions that come already inserted into the computers and machines within the lab. This makes this possibly the only place outside of Tabane’s personal lab capable of producing IS, as well as one of the very few places that can effectively alter or customise them.


-Library of the Lost (The Games we Play) (600 CP) 
Before the current setup rolled around, there were plenty of attempts by people to set up the whole ‘civilization’ thing. Vedic was an attempt, as were several others, mirroring nations you might recognize from your original world in strange ways. They all had their own discoveries and knowledge, potentially priceless things that were all lost nonetheless, to the relentless march of the Grimm. Not anymore, though. This is a complete, comprehensive collection of all the lost knowledge in the world! Anything that’s lost to the world, through the destruction of a civilization, no one speaking the language, or other mishaps, can be found here, explained clearly and plainly, ready to be brought back. This covers everything from martial skills, scientific knowledge to cultural details like Art and the rest. But again, only things that are specifically not in circulation in any real capacity in the modern day and age. Things like the protection skills Jaune acquired from the Mistral libraries can be found here, hunter training methods in active use can’t. If this needs to be said at this point, yes, this updates with the equivalent knowledge in all future jumps.
* Interestingly this is not limited to the planet, it covers every lost civ in the universe or possibly the local multiverse.


-Bioid Blueprints (Ben 10.01) (600CP)
Oh dear. Vilgax won’t be happy to find out someone stole his idea. These are blueprints for mass-producing an army of featureless androids with very basic AI. Their true power comes from the one commanding them, however...once synchronized to a commander (presumably you) they will transform to match you in body and DNA, becoming an army with your own abilities spread among them. Even better, if you have some way to synchronize them to a larger database, they can change into any existing DNA within said database. Considering all you have seen up to this point, you can see why such an army would be fearsome and able to conquer the universe, no? Be warned, if cut off from this network, these Bioids change back to normal and become harmless...so try to protect wherever they’re getting it from.


-Derelict Ship (DC Films) (600CP)
An additional ship from Krypton that arrived alongside the one that brought Superman to Earth. This ship has long since been abandoned, perhaps never even having a living pilot, and the systems relating to weaponry and movement have long since been irrevocably destroyed. However, it seems the ship was a science vessel and it retains an in depth database on almost all Kryptonian technology that existed. Weaponry, ships, armour, genetics and more are within the databanks here, governed by a friendly Artificial Intelligence that will assist you in learning all that is stored here.


-Building Better Worlds (Aliens vs Predator) (600CP) 
It seems you’ve got a lot of proprietary secrets packed away in that skull of yours; Weyland Yutani has its fingers in many pies, after all. All of that proprietary technology is resting at your fingertips: Atmospheric Processing Stations that can turn a barren, unbreathable moon into a world that humans can survive and thrive on. Starship drives that can punch through the speed of light to deliver passengers and cargo from distant worlds in a fraction of the time speed of light transports would take. Androids that are indistinguishable, in appearance and behaviour to humans, yet superior in almost every way. And lastly, genetic experimentation data collected from across inhabited space; enough to get you started should you need to modify a certain newly-discovered breed. All this and more are the tools at your command. Build a better world.


-Adoption Papers (Genius the Transgression) (600CP)
This is something that can't be, yet is. Brought to you by a friend to your 'in' at 'some cost' clearing up 'some debt'. A blueprint of a work you've never put together but still it is in your style with no error. A reposed wonder three-hundred years ahead of it’s time written out in gross detail through an accompanying journal allows you to fit all the pieces together, all you'll need to do is put it together. The finished product is a simple microchip that houses an AI. The true glory of this invention is the fact that the Ai itself is Inspired and because of programming always has a decent obligation to humanity. By inserting this technology into any willing mere mortal they will act as if they themselves had been Inspired, though not with the potential for growth that you have, never causing Havoc and even able to create Wonders.


-Tinker Data Core (Worm) (600CP) 
A computer containing a database of Tinker-Tech, including documentation, analysis, and blueprints. There's enough information here to advance science centuries should everything in here get properly examined and reverse engineered, although doing so would be the work of a lifetime or two. Still enough to keep a company several years ahead of its competitors for a very long time. This doesn't include all such tech in the Wormverse by any means, but barring some extraordinary effort or circumstances on your part its the closest you'll ever get.


-R&D Tech Database (Mass Effect Andromeda) (600CP) 
You gain access to a database with technology data from the Milky Way. This encompasses a wide variety of fields, from A to Z. Alternatively, you could instead have a similar database encompassing Heleus Cluster civilizations (excluding Remnant Tech). You could also pay an additional 100CP to get both Milky Way and Heleus databases. If you’ve already bought both of those, you can also pay an additional 200CP for access to a sprawling library of Remnant tech, enough to make Peebee swear eternal servitude to you just to have access to it. If you pay an additional 200CP on top of the Remnant tech option, this database will update per each civilization you interact with. Dead or remnant civilizations will take a bit of a research period before you get an update for them, but when you do, you’ll be the envy of any archeological expert in that civilization. But regardless of whatever level you buy, you have a media/cultural/historical archive of each culture/civilization you have the technology of. The dead/remnant civilizations still need to be researched first though.
* The 600cp cost includes all the upgrades


-Organic Database (Starcraft Zerg) (600CP)
It's a large, shell-encased... brain. The various wrinkles and lines within it seem to glimmer with green light, and aside from that it seems to be just odd. Within this brain, however, lies everything a growing leader of the Zerg could need to know: The genetic make-up and growth patterns of every Zerg organism ever, from the patterns of evolution that have resulted in the Zergling to the monolithic Leviathans used for inter-plane- tary travel.
* Overmind is a zerg organism and so are primals and hybrids so this has the info for all of them too.


-Timespinner Blueprints (Timespinner) (600CP)
 The blueprints and schematics for the device known as the Timespinner. It is a form of temporal gateway that is capable of precisely sending a user through time into the past or future. The ordinary version has several limitations, the most important of which is that travelling through it is a one-way trip, and results in the removal of the traveller from history, leaving them as a person without a history on the other side. Similarly, until upgraded by Lachiemi science, the portal only allowed for travel through time, not space, and would deposit the user at the same point, relative to the planet they are on, in whatever era they targeted. 
This version has altered those restrictions. Firstly, it is capable of travelling through both space and time. Secondly, it has a recall function, which allows a user who has travelled through it to ‘snap back’ to the device the moment after they went through, re-entering their old timeline at that point. 
The device does still retain the restriction that the timeline being travelled to will be one where the user never existed, but the recall function means that they can travel between that timeline and this one as they please. The third restriction is related to that, namely that this device can only target a single ‘new’ timeline per person per Jump, and thus that as they travel around in the new timeline and make changes, they will be making changes to the same timeline, even when they shift back and forth between the old and new timelines.
 It is possible to bring back objects from the new timeline into the old timeline, or vice versa, but not people. Finally, this Timespinner has safeguards to ensure that no matter how much you mess with time, it will not cause an existential breakdown or destroy the universe (which could be a danger with the normal Timespinner, or that might just be a lie told by the Sandman). This purchase does come with the necessary materials to make a single Timespinner, which will replenish at the beginning of each new Jump. A Timespinner can only target times and spaces within the current Jump.
* Worse than the tardis but the protection feature is unique


-Guide to Super Tech theory (Justice League Unlimited) (600CP)
This is some seriously dangerous stuff you're holding on to. These innocent looking books contain detailed information on the final project of the brilliant Professor Ivo, they explain a new type of nanotechnology that seems to combine several different branches of engineering, biology, and various other scientific fields in a way that should be impossible! With some extensive study you can figure out how to replicate this nanotech and create equipment capable of emulating supernatural powers from any source, be it magical, scientific, alien, anything! This science isn't exactly perfect however as you'll have to figure out the power in question before you can copy it, and that’s not taking into account how to implement such a power, but that’s is just the natural progression of super science. If you study hard enough you’ll eventually be able to recreate Ivo’s ultimate achievement, the ever evolving android know as AMAZO, an artificial being capable of instantly replicating the skills, abilities, equipment, and other properties of any living being it scans.


-Bowman's Schematics (Freefall) (600CP)
Using these plans, you could make learning AIs (though not seed AI) that are guaranteed to never go evil or try to take over. By following the instruction and diagrams even a layperson with only a very basic degree of construction skills, intelligence and the needed materials can make any of the AIs that Dr Bowman made in canon. This can also aid you if you an understanding of how to create other variations: it can be used not just for Planet Jean-style robots and Bowman's Wolves, but for other creations whether they are completely inorganic, organic, cyborgs, infomorphs, or really any other form you can build. For largely organic creations, Exo-Womb may be a good purchase. The only problem you might have is that they categorically refuse to fight any human. AI created with Bowman's Schematics not only won't harm a human by choice, they can't be hacked to do so. If someone or something successfully controls them, they could perhaps steal the robots monetary resources or perhaps damage them directly, but as soon as a human is in danger the hacker/controller will fail. I'm sure an enterprising person could find uses regardless of that. 


-Full Viltrumite Database (Invincible) (600CP)
You gain a full Viltrumite Empire database that adapts to be readable on any computer or similar device. Contained in this database is a copy of every piece of information ever developed by the Viltrumites or any of their slave races. This includes space tech, medical knowledge, history, and even the most classified of military secrets. It even holds the new invention of how to cure species specific super plagues, and lesser diseases


-Full Coalition Database (Invincible) (600CP)
You gain a full Coalition of Planets database that adapts to be readable on any computer or similar device. Contained in this database is a copy of every piece of information every developed by the Coalition or any of their member races. This includes space tech, medical knowledge, history, and even the most classified of military secrets. It even holds the knowledge of how to make tailored super-plagues of killing off specific species with zero chance of mutation or the plague affecting an undesired species, in addition to the creation of lesser diseases. 


-Jumper Asteroid (Justice League Unlimited) (600CP)
Located deep within a treacherous asteroid field, this intimidating extraterrestrial base is a replica of the secret fortress used by the super intelligent kryptonian A.I known as Brainiac. Although it’s much smaller than the original this space station is still comparable to the Watchtower in terms of size and internal space and it’s built in such a way that a single A.I can operate the facility by itself. While the exterior doesn’t have any noticeable features, aside from maybe a gigantic image of your face carved into the rock, the interior houses a large hanger bay, numerous defensive drones, an imposing throne room, and a massive digital library containing information on the culture, history, inhabitants, and technology of over a hundred worlds, including krypton. 
If someone were to study all the archives in this station they would gain incredible insights into robotics, cybernetics, energy weaponry, space travel, A.I, and many other topics from countless space faring civilizations. Enough to build weapons and starships that can pose a serious threat to Earth and Apokolips. 
Additionally this station contains a small fragment of Brainiac itself. The fragment is currently inactive and safe to handle, and while it would be possible for a smart enough individual to reverse engineer Brainiac's most powerful technology from this thing it would come at the cost of possibly awaking the copy of the A.I hidden inside and If that were to happen it would quickly attempt to possess whoever or whatever was nearby to ensure it's continued survival, replication, and improvement. 
However someone would have to be as smart as Lex Luthor in order to even have a chance of reactivating this device. If you do manage to get it working however then you’ll have a sample of the nanotech Brainiac uses to modify and posses living beings and assimilate alien technology. Aside from replicating the nanotech in this fragment you could also purposefully reawaken the copy of Brainiac stored within and try to use it for your own ends, but this really isn't recommended since it's a crazy murderous A.I that's only interesting in collecting knowledge. If you do manage to reawaken Brainiac it won't count as a companion.
* Braniac fragment is a part of this perk


-Conversion Gel Recipe | Repulsion Gel Recipe | Repulsion Gel Recipe | Unexplained Science Thing (Portal) (600CP)
Conversion Gel recipe (100CP) This is a recipe for Aperture’s Conversion Gel, which makes any surface it coats able to conduct a portal. More importantly, it’s a huge improvement over Aperture’s current bank-breaking recipe. Ground up rocks from any object considered a moon will work, mixed with the recipe for especially thick Jello. Washes off with water. 
Repulsion Gel recipe (200CP) This is a recipe for Aperture’s Repulsion Gel, a blue liquid which repulses anything which touches it. Other names include “that bouncy stuff,” “the blue gel,” and “unknown skeleton-hating element.” Unlike Aperture’s current expensive and lengthy recipe, this one involves precisely combining rubber with hydrogen and oxygen. Blue dye is optional. Washes off with water. Why is this recipe so expensive? Repulsion Gel can be used as a potent weapon against anything mobile that relies on solid structural integrity by covering that thing in the Gel. It will repulse any movement back in the other direction, creating a movement which is then repulsed in the other direction by the Gel covering the other size of that thing. One twitch becomes movement in every direction at terminal velocity, tearing that thing apart. This includes the human body. 
Propulsion Gel recipe (100CP) This is a recipe….. Okay, you get the picture. The acceleration gel is created by adding seemingly random elements to a modern recipe for no-stick spray. The gel increases the velocity of any object moving on it unless that object is at rest. Washes off with water 
Unexplained Science Thing (200CP) You have no idea what this thing does. No idea at all! It could have the effect of any one of Aperture’s miscellaneous inventions depending on how you try to use it. Shape the ill-defined mass into the shape of a disk and put it in a computer? You’ve discovered the annotated source code for Aperture’s OS, able to run an AI on the power from a potato battery. Disperse it into an air vent and record the results? You now have the ability to convert type AB blood into pure gasoline with laser technology. There’s only enough Unexplained Science Thing for it to be a single one of Aperture’s innovations not already listed here. Choose wisely! 


-Amazo’s Backup Memory (Young Justice) (800CP)
This memory stick contains the encrypted memories of the android Amazo, and more importantly, contains the information on how the android replicated the abilities of the Justice League. After breaking the encryption you will have all the information you need to incorporate superhuman abilities you possess into your technology, creating machines that speak to each other with telepathy, process information with super speed, lift great weights with actual super strength and more.


-The Ruins (Doom 3) (800CP) 
One of the most important fields of research in the UAC Mars base involves physics, dimensional technologies, organic technology, and many more things… but it starts with history. Beneath the base lies a vast network of ruins, burial chambers and other structures belonging to the long-dead inhabitants of Mars - a people that some theorize are in fact the ancient progenitors of humanity itself. Though heavily damaged and weathered by the passage of time, many of the devices within still function, and the inscriptions recovered from the Martian dig sites have contained information beyond anything humanity understood - leading to some of the most advanced scientific theories of the modern day. You are now in charge of a sizable dig site working through these ruins, with direct authority over the discoveries made within. In future worlds, you will likewise come into possession of a similarly vast Archaeological site, belonging to a suitably powerful precursor from the setting you are in. Predicting what kind of advances might be realized through investigating these ruins will be difficult… but no matter what, results will always be spectacular in some way.


-The Holy Grail (Girl Genius SB) (800CP)
Well not quite, but it might as well be. This is something literally any spark in this world would kill for, something that, if it were out in the open, would cause a furore that would make the Long War look like a childish squabble. Attached to your warehouse is an archive holding a complete, unabridged, detailed history of this world, all the way from the dawn of the very first civilization to the second before you enter the world. Every war stratagem, every population census, the name of every ruler, it’s all recorded here in extensive detail. But that’s not what would attract people to it like moths to a flame. That would be the Scientific archive. Because you see, this archive also holds literally every scrap of knowledge this world has ever discovered or used. Every novel or book ever written, every scientific principle discovered, every paper, journal article or private message, the blueprints for each and every device made throughout the history of the planet, the details of the Second Breakthrough... everything. Don’t go showing it off, yeah? In future worlds too, this updates to hold the same level of information on local things.
* Sparks make some crazy good stuff


-Unabridged Memory Banks (Green lantern) (800CP) 
Ooh. The Guardians would go apeshit if they knew you had this. This is a full-fledged, unabridged copy of the Oan archives, the sum total of the Guardians and the Green Lantern corps’ history and knowledge base. Somewhere deep in these records there is even the lore of harnessing emotional lights and making lantern rings, but it took the hyper-intelligent guardians literal ages in time and untold amounts of resources to do it, so...y’know. If you have a power ring this data is placed in its memory banks, but you can get it in any other medium that you desire as well.


-Orb Design Plans (Swat Kats) (800CP)
Well... this is curious. The design plans for a Micro-Brain Repair Unit... this won't show up for some time, but it is quite useful nonetheless. Once assembled, it will have the ability to scan and repair any damaged machinery it comes across, simply by using the materials around it. The more advanced the machine is, the longer it will take... but it will do its job. Even more concerningly, it has the ability to learn and adapt itself, assimilating machinery to create a more grand body. It may come with existential issues... are you sure you want this?


-Omnitrix (Ben 10 0.1) (800CP)
This will one day be called the mightiest weapon in the universe. It is the magnum opus of the genius Galvan Azmuth and, should things proceed as normal, will spark the legend of Ben Tennyson – a superhero with the power of many aliens. With this purchase, you now have your very own. The Omnitrix is a database of alien DNA that allows the user to temporarily transform into a copy of that very same species, with all the strengths and weaknesses therein, before changing back to normal. This device is both insanely versatile and capable, so let’s see what we can do to personalize your own version of it. For this section, you receive +1000 Omnitrix Points, or OP. You may gain addition OP by converting choice points on a 1:1 ratio, getting 50 OP for 50 CP and so forth. You may not convert OP back to Choice Points, in case it needs to be said.


Archives (Doctor Who) (800CP)
Man, if word of this got out... anyway, this is a small technological database holding some... knowledge. Massive, impossible amounts of knowledge, all stored in a tiny little thing like this... Okay, so the way this works is, for 200 CP, you can get the whole techbase of one of the ‘less’ advanced species. Sontarans, Silurians, and their like. This would be a complete database, with complete and full information on every piece of technology they have. Cloning, spaceships, hibernation, the works.
The 400 CP version lets you get tech from the more advanced species, instead, like ‘future humanity’ with Time Travel and Galaxy Cracker bombs, or data on similar levels from other species like the Time Lords or so.
For 800 CP, though... all bets are off. This is the complete, no-holds barred archive of every single scrap of knowledge ever assembled in the history of this universe. From the blood and magic manipulations of the Carrionites, to the works crafted by the Ancients to bind the Beast, to every piece of Time Lord and Dalek technology, the in-depth studies of Time Lord biologies... the mother lode. It’s all here,everything, ready for you to learn, teach others, and use however you will.
Jumpers of any particular species can take their species’s archives at a discount... except Daleks and Time Lords, who can at best get the 400 level info at a discount. The 800 CP archive is not discounted to anyone. In future jumps, wherever applicable every version updates to hold the same level of knowledge from the local universe.

Magitech Databases 


-Designs (Arcanum Of Steamworks And Magic Obscura) (50CP)
This small portfolio contains any three schematics of your choice, out of any you might find in Arcanum. You may choose both standard technologies such as the Feather Weight Axe and Elephant Rifle, as well as prototype inventions that aren’t found in the curriculum of the technological disciplines, such as those for the Miracle Cure, Electro Armor or Tranquilizer Gun.


-Spell Compendium (The Irregular At The Magic Highschool) (100CP)
This small PDA-like device contains a large selection of Activation and Magic Sequences for your personal use. Secret or unique Sequences cannot be included in this selection.


-HardTech Psi-Detector (Trinity) (200CP)
You have acquired a Nippon-made device, one of the very few non-biotech devices capable of reliably detecting nearby Psions and psionic powers in use. Most are massive, power-hungry, and have a range of only about five meters . This one has the same range, but is far more efficient and only the size of a large book. Though pretty much useless to a Psion in the field, the device can be connected to mundane security and sensor systems, and you have the blueprints to make more. 


-OrgoTek Bioware Database (Trinity) (400CP)
A large and comprehensive store of both theory and blueprints, this contains detailed notes on everything made by OrgoTek and its subsidiaries. This includes everything from commercial hardtech products to military-grade VARGs and BioVARGs, biotech space fighters, and lots of bioware commonly used by Psions. This doesn't contain every bit of tech in the Trinity universe, and does not hold schematics for the most advanced computers and the Tesser drives that are integral to Leviathan construction. But it's still a major technological resource.


-Great Library of The Heavens (I Saved Too Many Girls And Caused The Apocalypse) (600CP)
A perfect copy of the library in Laputa, and the key to understanding their astonishing technology. It holds the same knowledge as the original, from flying ships, secret martial techniques to a record of all species in the planet and technology that won’t be developed until thousands of years in the future. It’s the same knowledge that made the people in Laputa grow lazy and conformist, so be careful.


-Relic Of The Future (I Saved Too Many Girls And Caused The Apocalypse) (600CP)
The lost technology that allowed Atlantis to maintain itself for as long as it did. These are the notes and blueprints revealing the secret of the ‘space-time stitching’ technology. Once everything is properly set, it can send back the user in time, much like the ‘save’ function in a game. It can’t go before the machine itself was activated, nor it stops the user from getting older as they experience those futures.


-Ar Tonelico? (Ar Tonelico) (200CP)
A device the size of a basketball, overlapping wings that shelter a golden core. Whoever assembled it left a big shiny key inserted into the top? Mysterious. Comes with its recipe, as well as the recipes for two weapons, armours, vehicles, accessories and restoratives of your preference – all of the highest quality.
* The Ar tonelico is a sonic detonator, roughly equivalent to an H-Bomb in destructive power. It is a flawed, miniaturised form of Ar Tonelico’s power conversion and emission systems – minus the Orgel.


-Gem furnace schematics (Dungeon Keeper Ami) (200CP)
The secret to Empress Mercury's wealth has never been obtained by any who have attempted to find its origin but you have something that may just be able to one day rival her great wealth. These schematics detail a large furnace powered by magic and technology, once a day it produces Gemstones of your choice though it requires occasional cleaning to keep it in good working order. Please be warned people here would kill for this at the least, or make the price of gemstones plummet.


-Future Plans (Fate Grand Order) (600CP)
The Chaldea organisation has, in the past few years, created a variety of pieces of technology that are closer to being miracles than any sort of magic or science of the modern day. Observing the past, transferring the minds/spirits of beings in the present to other times, combining the Heroic Spirits of the past with living beings in the modern day, this group has made some awe inspiring stuff. The hard drive before you has the collected research, notes and findings on every piece of technology and magic utilised by the Chaldea organisation. Their great technologies and their small spells, how they came to understanding and making these things is all collected within this one electronic database. With careful study and research, you’ll be able to replicate them all even in future worlds and perhaps to even greater effect, if you spend the needed time.


-Starro-tech Notes (Young Justice) (600CP)
These notes detail the research Professor Ivo, Brain, and Klarion the Witch Boy took in order to create Starro-tech; a combination of technology, magic, and an ancient alien organism. With time, and some studies of your own, you may be able to apply the principles of Starro-tech to your creations as well, creating technology and creatures that have features of living beings, magic, and technology.


-Future Data (World Seed) (600CP)
Now, what interesting little thing do you have here? It seems like somehow, you have the fully compiled data and knowledge from the entirety of Neolife, an artificial future set 3000 years after the current time, all contained within a tiny little USB stick. This includes technology and magitech schematics, the research on countless spells and abilities, a bestiary and the aura-makeup of nigh-any creature and animal ever recorded, star maps, and even all the movies and songs known at that point in time. It isn’t limited to a single galaxy, but rather contains data from the entire universe in Neolife. Let alone several lifetimes, you’d probably need an entire planet worth of people sifting through those records for the same amount of time if you want to catalogue everything. 
But believe me, it is very much worth the effort. If you shared this with the galactic community, you’d be able to prevent many possible and very real problems from popping up, and everyone could get their foot in the door that much sooner.
Perhaps even more interestingly, this USB stick will update itself as you travel to other worlds, granting you the same data about their own futures, and even works retroactively, covering settings you have been to in the past. Of course, that’s only if they even have a future. Exactly from how far off in the future you get this data depends on how far along the society of a world is. If you spent ten years in a setting fighting dinosaurs, well, the records you get might be from a few dozen million years in the future, while starting on a 21st century Earth would give you data a few thousand years in the future as normal, give or take.


-Ran'Tao's Notes - The Origin Of The Bount (Bleach 4.03) (600CP)
These notes contain the records and details of each experiment done by the scientist Ran'Tao, including the failed Bount Experiment. This even includes a few of her own personal thoughts and ideas. Maybe these can be of some use to you. In addition, the prototype of the doll summoning ritual can be found inside. Naturally just the notes would probably be useless to you, so if you purchase them here you are guaranteed, with time, study, and effort, to at least be capable of recreating her work. With even more time, and considerable genius on your part, you might even be able to improve on it.


-Necronium Depletion (GURPS Technomancer) (600CP)
When magic was introduced to the world, it seemed like an absolute advantage for those who had it over those who didn’t. Fortunately, there was a magic bullet - or more accurately, an anti magic ​bullet. You’ve mastered the ability to create Depleted Necronium, a special metal that can utterly negate the effects of magic, treating it as nonexistent whenever it would matter. A DN bullet would ignore a Mage’s bullet ward, while a DN sword would treat the flesh of a Mage who’d turned into air as, well, flesh instead of harmlessly slicing through air. Interestingly, your particular formula extends to ​all supernatural effects.


-Blueprints | Research Notes | Dark Journal  (Van Helsing) (600CP)
Blueprints (200CP) An archive of scrolls, each holding the plans & blueprints for numerous gadgets & pieces of equipment notably used by vampire hunters - in particular, the Van Helsing clan. Spring-loaded blade traps hidden in one’s hat are among the simplest of things one can make here.
Research Notes (200CP) A tome of notes compiled by numerous doctors in biology, including one Doctor Frankenstein. These notes detail much about biological make-up of different creatures. But... wait, what’s this? A hidden flap in the last half of the tome reveals a smaller book - filled to the brim with dark, scientific knowledge.  With this knowledge, you are capable of creating life - creating monsters like Adam, creatures sewn from flesh and defying the laws of reality by their mere existence.
Dark Journal (200CP) An inconspicuous, black leather journal. Not that big, so you wouldn’t expect much. It’s contents prove surprising however - for what you hold is no ordinary journal, but possibly the largest composition of necromantic rituals in existence. Each page details the rituals required to create - and control - a great variety of undead monsters. Ranging from ghouls, ghosts, and skeletons to vampires & even more monstrous beings, you’ll have no lack of possible minions. Note: The rituals for higher-powered undead will take more material - and more time - to enact.
* If you check the Van helsing jumpchain, just below the blueprints, research notes and dark journal, it mentions that all of these are written by the same person and having all of them will let you combine the last pages from each book, in order to construct, and I quote”technological marvels and monstrous creations unlike any other” It apparently merges science technology and magic in seamless harmony.


-Technical Specialist|Forceful Engineer|Extragalactic Tech (Darth Bane) (700CP)
Technical Specialist (300 CP): It is arguable that this galaxy has, on the whole, reached a technological plateau. This bar may be relatively high if one was to compare it to that of previous Jumps. Sentient computer systems, widely available commercial FTL, weapons that can scour planets, miraculous medical technology and gravity manipulation to name a few. An extremely comprehensive database of all these discoveries, refined and developed over the course of millennia, will be mentally accessible for you. Should you have the resources and tools on hand, there’s no reason you couldn’t create almost anything natively produced in this galaxy.
Forceful Engineer (200 CP): Force sensitive individuals and species have created wondrous unions of engineering genius and Force energies. Prisons to hold eldritch nightmares, holocrons and seemingly infinite factories that strip entire stars for the resources needed for your unending fleets. You are inspired when it comes to the design of such marvels, even being able to use the Light Side for unseen effects. This brilliance extends beyond the Force into the wider realm of ‘Magitek’. The potential trichotomy of Machine, ‘Magic’ and The Force could give birth to near unimaginable wonders for the inventive mind.
Extragalactic Tech (200 CP): Exo-technology is a field of science that specialized in studying in combining the technologies of various species of the galaxy. Your nature as a Jumper allows you to go beyond merely marrying the design sensibilities of several alien peoples. You easily blend the the varying physical laws and examples of causality you’ve encountered in the creation of any one thing.




-Fullbringing For Fun And Profit (Bleach 4.03) (800CP)
This isn't so much a book on how to create fullbringers as it is a book on how to get rid of them. Notes on how to control which upgrade is obtained after stealing a focus item, on how to give them to a substitute, and even on how to get them back from a substitute. There’s even a theorized idea on injecting hollow particles into humans to make them, but that’s the only mention of it. Also lists every active fullbringer in the world in the back.

-Shadow Clones (Generic Naruto Fanfiction) (100CP)
 Ah, shadow clone no jutsu. The signature jutsu of the Naruto franchise. And now you can join in on the fun. You have a copy of a technique scroll for the shadow clone jutsu, of such quality that an idiot could teach himself from this thing in virtually no time at all. It even has safeguards built-in that eliminate any possibility of killing yourself by putting too much chakra into it, or getting a headache from too many clones dispelling at once or anything like that. The worst that can possibly happen is that it fails to work. You still can only make as many shadow clones as your chakra can support but outside of that you can feel free to abuse this handy jutsu for training, decoys, diversions, paperwork, chores, or whatever else you can imagine. In the event that this technique is supposed to have some additional features in the particular fanfiction you go to, or even a better version, this scroll will contain both versions.
* Some of the best shadow clone fanfic features include shadow clone self charka regeneration, temporal split clones instead of normal clones, mind merging without dispel, constant hivemind like connection etc




-Inkgate Schemata (Van Helsing) (200CP)
Normally one only finds these in Borgovia, where the ‘veil’ between the real world and the Ink is thinnest. Also mostly as the ‘Ink’ is practically unknown outside of Borgovia. Regardless, the Inkgates you can learn to create with this schematic will allow you to use the inky blackness between worlds as a method of teleportation. These gates, once made, are indestructible - but unfortunately (or fortunately) can be used by anyone so long as they know the command word. Note: Interplanetary Inkgate systems are slightly outside of the schematic parameters.


-Schoolbooks (Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality) (200CP)
You gain a collection of all of your school materials for a seven year course at Hogwarts (assuming Defense Against the Dark Arts is taught by a competent professor assigning a high-quality set text for all seven years, so in reality probably a bit better in that regard), as well as Muggle school up through British Secondary School. Learning and teaching from these books is easier than normal, enough to almost make up for a lack of an instructor. Lost or gifted books are replaced via owl order within one week at no cost to you. Yes, even if there’s no logical way for an owl to reach you with a full set of magical textbooks. If your starting age is above 11, you’re assumed to have been learning at an appropriate pace from these books for however long you’ve been at Hogwarts, or should have been at Hogwarts in the case of a Drop-In. Post-Jump, anyone studying from a set of magic textbooks which they own gains the ability to use Atlantean Magic. Gifted and re-gifted books never lose the magic-granting ability, stolen books do not grant magic until returned to the rightful owner.


-Ritualist’s Library (Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality) (200CP) 
You have here a great treasure trove of knowledge; a library of books from ritualists across the world, since the time of Merlin onwards. Each of these tomes is a copy of the personal notes of a powerful magus who researched and recorded at least one ritual. These notes are incredibly useful, containing several potent rituals, but that’s not what’s special about them. The real power in this library lies in something it lacks; the Interdict of Merlin. The books in this trove bypass the Interdict, allowing anyone who reads one to learn magic sealed behind that ancient law without the aid of another living mind.


-Mysterious Blueprints (Bleach) (200CP) 
Near undecipherable prints that seem to detail the creation of specific races. You’re gonna be looking at this for a while.
* Details the creation of all the bleach races


-Golem Formula (Generic Isekai) (200CP) 
This is a set of instructions on the creation and control of simple humanoid golems, made from earth, stone or wood. The golems it describes are weaker than a human adult, but tireless and mindlessly obedient to their creator. Though casting the creation spell is costly for a beginner, it is not impossible, and will grow easier with practice. Comes with one golem premade.




-Book​ ​of​ ​Basic​ ​Formations ​(Desolate Era Part I The Three Realms) ​(200CP)
 ​​A​ ​book​ ​detailing​ ​the​ ​various​ ​ways​ ​formations​ ​work and​ ​how​ ​to​ ​master​ ​the​ ​basics.​ ​With​ ​such​ ​good​ ​instructions,​ ​anyone​ ​could​ ​begin​ ​to​ ​learn​ ​the​ ​Dao​ ​of Formations,​ ​although​ ​its​ ​eventual​ ​mastery​ ​depends​ ​on​ ​your​ ​own​ ​effort​ ​and​ ​skill.​ ​The​ ​book​ ​updates to​ ​be​ ​appropriate​ ​to​ ​your​ ​level​ ​of​ ​cultivation,​ ​so​ ​it’ll​ ​never​ ​be​ ​useless.
* Not just a type of runes, you will need resources to make anything, quite expensive ones too.


-Forbidden Book of Attribute Metals(The Death mage who doesn’t want a fourth time) (200CP)
Death Iron and Dark Copper, Life Gold and Soul Silver. Metals created by the esteemed dhampir Vandalieu using his Death magic and raw metals, changing the metals into more powerful forms on par with adamantite and Mythril, or into rare and unique metals capable of influencing the soul and body themselves. While this option does not give you said metal, what you are instead given is a guide on how to imbue Attribute mana into metals to create entirely new forms. These new metals will each be unique in some way, such as being liquid until heated a great deal, and will in turn each possess powerful and useful abilities related to their element. A liquid metal that heals those who eat it and metal that somehow affects the soul itself, this and other effects unknown and untold are yours for the discovering. Just note, however, that a great deal of mana will be required, and perhaps a method to speed it all along. 
* Existing examples are death magic
* Death iron:  Better than steel, liquid until heated, self repairing, only forgable by undead, easier to enchant with death magic
* Dark Copper: Impact resistent, liquid until heated, self repairing, only forgable by undead, easier to enchant with death magic
* Soul Silver: Used to make life with a soul in setting,
* Life Gold: Heals people who eat it.
* Attributes include Fire, Water, Earth, Wind, Light, Time, Space, Life, death. Fanwank each metal combined with each magic, assume that it probably doesn’t touch the soul since that’s death magics thing, and is easier to enchant with same attribute magic, and it might not be immediately combat useful.


-Forbidden Book of the Craft (The Death Mage who doesn’t want a fourth time) (200CP) 
Weapons. Armor. Tools. All are needed in daily life, all to build, to hunt, to thrive. And where do they come from when one does not live in human society, where there is not a mine to be found or a field to grow plants or animals in? Monsters. The scales of dragons, the claws of wyverns, the bones of dinosaurs, from all of these things can tools be made, though it would take someone who is quite creative to figure out how some of them can be made. That’s where this comes in, as detailed within this book are guides on what can be made from which animals, which plants, and which monsters, as well as where all of its components can be found. Plate armor from a dragon’s scales, a spear from a wyvern’s claw, a club from a dinosaur’s bones, all this and much more are described within, though the exact techniques to combine these materials will be left to you. 
* Standard fantasy fare.


-Alchemical Textbooks (Fullmetal Alchemist) (300CP)

-Anti-sensei formula (Assassination Classroom) (300CP)
You know the formula of the Anti-Sensei material. This chemical is able to be applied to anything if you put your mind to it. Clothing made out of this substance are unable to be handled by Korosensei without his tentacles.
* Anti-Sensei Weapons - Weapons and bullets made out of this strange material is only thing that's able to actually harm Korosensei. They're completely harmless to normal people, and are a staple given to the students and teachers of 3-E. Outside of the jump they're able to harm all but the toughest monsters, only the items bought with cp have this effect..


-Talking Head (Dresden files) (300CP)
 Something between a magical computer and a lab assistant, this Spirit of Intellect would have forgotten more about magic than most wizards ever knew if it was actually capable of forgetting without being ordered to. Its personality is something between your own and how you think it should behave, which means you're probably getting something close to Bob if you're not careful. Aside from dispensing forgotten lore, they're able to possess and control things, ranging from friendly dire housecats to giant stone lions, and can even act as an emergency mystical battery if need be. Includes a free storage skull.


-Completed research (Dungeon Keeper) (300CP)
This thick tome holds detailed mechanical and arcane notes that will teach you how to build and use all the keeper spells, rooms, traps and mechanisms within the Dungeon Keeper series.  This also includes the personal spells used by individual units, from the lightning used by dark mistresses to the tricks imps use to dig, claim territory and reinforce walls.


-Library of Sorrow (Skulduggery Pleasant) (400CP)
China Sorrows is many things, but above all else, she is a collector of all things magical. Nowhere is this more apparent than in her library, a home to many lost and obscure magical tomes. Now, it seems you have come to possess a library of your own, equally massive and chock full of rare, obscure, and lost magical knowledge. In future Jumps, this library will update and expand to encompass the vast majority of that world’s historical magical knowledge, barring tomes that are one-of-a-kind. You’ll need to get those yourself.


-Uchiha Jutsu Archive (Generic Naruto Fanfiction) (400CP)
The Uchiha really were quite shameless in their day, always going around copying everybody else’s lifetimes of hard work just by using their special eyes. Well, at least you get to benefit from that. Somehow you’ve obtained a copy of the complete Uchiha Jutsu Archive, everything that several generations of dedicated intellectual property thieves could copy from every other ninja village, clan and small ninja child in the Elemental Nations. Pretty much any and every technique, seal, chemical formula, pill/cookie recipe or random dance routine that that one Uchiha liked can be found in here. Any knowledge that wasn’t limited to literally just one person, family, or bloodline or was based purely on sealless chakra manipulation (such as the Rasengan) and thus uncopyable by the Sharingan is in the archive, all of them laid out in such a clear and concise format that any half-competent ninja could teach himself just by reading the scroll. This archive will update with a complete set of spells, fighting styles, etc, etc. from any setting that you have visited and will visit in the future. Provided it could be generously called public, or even semi-private, knowledge it will be in here. Only the most super-secret, utterly private techniques are missing; after all, even the best copyright pirates can’t get everything. This place is comprehensively warded against thievery, somewhat ironically, and it would take a team of top-tier infiltration specialists to even attempt to breach it. Of course its best defense is that, at least at jump start, no one knows you have it. Post jump you can have this become a warehouse attachment.


-Roman Manuals and Gallic Recipes (Asterix the Gaul) (400CP)
​These are a collection of every potion seen in the series, and also every single artefact, such as the collapsing chariots for one, ever used by a roman. Thrown in are all the mundane materials such as Gallic food and medicine recipes, wine-making tricks...if it counts as a recipe used by the Gallic people at this point of time or any time previously, it’s in this collections, just as every single item that could be considered a Roman manual, including the details for their roads, their galleys, their military doctrine, all are collated into the manuals.


-Grand Library (Dishonored 2) (400CP)
Built of dark grey stone and the rich wood of Serkonos’s mountain forests, the grand library seems embedded with a chasm, crossed with catwalks and bridges. It contains thousands of books, painstakingly hand-written on occult and metaphysical topics, and hundreds of years of research on the astronomy and metaphysics of the world can be found in their leather covers. While rare diamonds of practical knowledge are scattered between the books, the more academic literature is likely to help you in developing your own magics or rituals. The Grand Library updates for each new jump, adding further shelves of books along grey stone escarpments, and providing a comprehensive academic knowledge base of the metaphysics, magic and dimensions of your local setting, though it will not contain books which already exist. The Grand Library attaches to your Cosmic Warehouse or other pocket dimension.


-Time Circuitry (Marvel Magic) (400CP)
​There are those with the power to turn even the currents of time itself against you. But you have methods of defending yourself. These schematics show you what is required to integrate time circuitry into other technology, perhaps as cybernetics or for your armor. While worn or otherwise integrated with your body, you will be protected from temporal manipulations, be it attempts to freeze you in time, cast you adrift in its flows, or even to kill your past self. You need never again fear such attacks so long as you wear this armor. If you bought the Magitech Armor above then you may choose to already have this integrated.


-Notes of Thoth (Kane chronicles) (400CP)
When Thoth, the god of writing, knowledge, and magic was young, he traveled to the far reaches of the Duat, researching the natures and mechanics of those regions, as well as the spirits and gods that called those places home. His field notes - and the many powers and dangerous spells that resulted from them, later became known as the Book of Thoth. By purchasing this, you gain a collection of his notes about the nature of gods, spirits, and other dimensions and planes of existence in this setting, which could be
used to invent many of the spells the Book contained for yourself. Post-jump, these notes will update to include the local versions of such things in new settings.


-Do it yourself Dungeon heart (Dungeon Keeper Ami) (400CP)
Not exactly a dungeon heart, this is actually a book explaining how to make the gold powered dungeon hearts found on the avatar islands, though it relies less on the power of the dark gods for mana it also has a much lower output than the older model organic dungeon hearts. While a person can be made a keeper using this kind of heart and existing keepers can use them as well it has many flaws such as the inability to create living imps, having a much much lower mana output than normal keeper hearts, requiring large amounts of gold in order for it to create mana as a normal heart would. On the plus side you can change its looks to some extent, generally it will keep the glowing orb in the center in some fashion but the other parts can be changed into quite a few different designs from plant statues, to bones, even a small crystal pyramid.


-Mystical Dojo | Chakra Books (MCU vol.2)  (500CP)
Mystical Dojo (400CP) : For the Masters of the Mystic Arts, the grounds of Kamar- Taj is their sanctuary, their fortress, and their school all in one. It is a place where they can open their mind, and truly ascend to new heights in awareness as they explore Creation itself. Alas... even they knew not to focus everything in one place, and it is with that in mind that I offer you this. Whether you wish to place this in a mountain range so that it is hidden away from the eyes of most, or have it as a Warehouse attachment, this ancient site contains everything one needs to build an order. Rooms for monks to stay in, a great library to fill with many books, a courtyard to practice, an armory for magical items you may possess, and even a storage unit that supplies as much mundane food, water, and tea to sate those who follow the Mystic Arts. Even better, those who practice here will find their minds opening more quickly than usual, having an accelerated effect that will leave training of the body and mystical practices half again as effective. ...oh, and there’s a wifi router installed.
Chakra Books (100CP) : It can be difficult for those who are unaware of the world around them to grasp that they know nothing. It can also be difficult to show them just how small their worldview has been all this time, or help them. But the first step to learning is awareness. This is a substantial supply of books regarding the body, such as a map of the nervous system, MRIs, and more importantly, chakra points and how to open them. These maps for the body will help bring awareness to would-be students, and how to show them the wonders of the world or themselves. For an additional undiscounted 100CP, you may also gain a substantial collection of spellbooks that will assist in helping you learn the formation of spells, the art of drawing energies to power them, and the basics in casting them. Just be aware that the warning labels come AFTER the spells.



-Archamada Book of Spells (Ben 10) (600CP)
In this book you will find some of the strongest spells in the known universe. You can find spells that summon town destroying storms, bring statues to life, and even allow you to travel through time. These spells require a lot of power and skill to use, so you better be ridiculously strong (or at least have a strong source of magic to draw on) and really good if you plan to use them. The time travel spell won’t actually work until you’re done jumping, though.


-Tattered Journal (Highschool DxD) (600CP)
 Where’d you get this? This is an old journal written by a Fallen Angel of unknown origin. It’s written in both an old language and in code, but if you were to translate it, you would eventually discover details on a powerful magical art - the art of sealing powerful entities, even contradictory ones, into a single vessel to create artifacts similar to Sacred Gears. These items would gain a host of powers from the being that was sealed away, though the ritual is costly depending on how strong said being is...perhaps you could find a use for it?


-Library of Raum (The Dark Wolf Shiro) (600CP)
​The biggest library of magical knowledge in all of Europe and most likely the world. This library is chock full of all types of spells, potions, runes, history, forbidden magic you name it. This library has it. But that alone is not what makes this a 600 CP purchase what makes it that is in future jumps this fills with every slip of magical knowledge in that world even those that were never written down or even lost to time it’s all there and don’t worry you keep the knowledge of past worlds/jumps too.
* This is from an extremely OP HP fanfic, demon and god magic flavored


-Old Fashioned Magic (Youjo Senki) (600CP) 
A collection of magical implements from before the days of industrialization. In other words, mystical books full of strange rituals, handcrafted wands and staves, strange reagents, and heavy robes and wizard hats. Unlikely to ever match an Orb for raw power or speed. However, they come with an interesting inversion. Over the years of being used, ambient magic has seeped into them. Even someone with no magical potential could make use of the things found here.


-Magnus Recipe (God Catching Alchemy Meister) (600CP)
To become a Magnus in the Alchemist Guild you need a grand project, something that puts your name and face in the minds of alchemists throughout the world. This is obviously a difficult task, but this little notebook is an amalgamation of notes and ideas that could elevate you to the rank of Magnus once joined and implemented. You may select the precise nature of what the final form of this project is, but it will be at the level of a sword that nulls magic, a potion that cure all diseases or armor that makes the user immune to physical attacks.


-Aizen's Guide to Hollow Modification (Bleach 4.03) (800CP) 
A large textbook, presumably written by aizen, but you never know with him, that details a number of his experiments on hollows---White, Wonderweiss, and Tousen---and the modifications he made to them. While there are no step by step instructions, with a little work you should be able to figure out the patterns that exist, and with a lot of work, reverse engineer them and adapt them to new hollows.


-The Hands of the Maker (Generic Exalted) (800CP) 
You have gained a forbidden knowledge. A dusty tome has come into your possession and within it dwells the secrets of producing Alchemical Exalted, one of the greatest creations ever made by a Titan devoted to Craft. It could take a hundred mortal lifetimes to glean even the barest secrets of this knowledge, though one who is Exalted above others might manage it in as little as one. It contains instructions on how to make all the various types of Alchemical Exalted and, unlike the Alchemicals that were first created, these instructions show how to create improved versions. Ones that are immune to the dread sickness that so afflicted the Maker and far less susceptible to the vagaries of Clarity.  This is only the knowledge to create these beings, and someone that desires to make use of this knowledge will need to secure the materials, infrastructure, and other reagents needed on their own. The Jumper, and only the Jumper, is guaranteed to one day be able to make Alchemical Exalts if they study this, even if they wouldn't normally be capable of such, though it may take a very long time indeed. While you may discover the method of the creation of Alchemicals, how their Exaltation itself is formed will elude you, no matter what method you attempt, until such time as you have gained your Spark.  Further you will discover that no method you are capable of will be able to utilize the Alchemical Exaltation for anything other than powering the Alchemical that it has attached itself to. This, too, will be something that will be beyond your comprehension until such a time as you have gained your Spark. As a reminder Alchemicals were once people and while the process may have changed them both in looks and abilities they are people still. So unless you take them as companions, or have some other method of bringing them with you into future worlds, you will not be able to take them with you. Finally the process of making an Alchemical does not infuse into them any sort of loyalty to you, so beware if you have used this knowledge to force this condition upon the unwilling.


-Stuff You Need To Know About Asauchi (Bleach 4.03) (800CP) 
Written by Oetsu Nimaiya, this Notebook describes the process, techniques, and materials used in his creation of the first few Asauchi. For starters, you need a blacksmith's forge, a menos class hollow, some ridiculously hot flames, and a small ocean of water to cool it off afterwards. Mind you, this book only details the first few Asauchi, whom Oetsu declared failures. Making a 'proper' Asauchi will require time and experimentation.


-The Quincy Alphabet (Bleach 4.03) (800CP)
This is Yhwach's diary. It's pink, covered in glitter, and it looks like it’s written in 57 different languages. Good luck translating it. But if you do manage to do so, and I can assure you ten years isn't enough time to do so, it contains instructions on everything Quincy related. From how to lobotomize your own soul and give it to others, thus making them Quincy, to how to reintegrate those pieces, and how to make the Schrift out of them. Also contains instructions on how to make all of the Quincy weaponry. The Bankai stealing medallion is notably absent.


-Sithe Blueprints (Desolate Era Part II The Chaosverse) (800CP)
The Sithe are many things. What they cannot be considered however is inept. Their technology puts everything within this Chaosverse to complete shame. With this item you gain blueprints with details on how to create any and all Sithe technologies, from Realmships, to even something like the Decimatus Wave. The instructions are good enough that even a newly ascended World God could make full use of them. Of course these technologies require materials that may not exist in this Chaosverse, thus many equivalents are listed in the plans.  
* Sithe are as the perk suggests, from a different Chaosverse, with different Prime Daos. Tech works fine in the protags Chaosverse, through, but they can’t build it.
* This is a cultivation setting, meaning tech is OP, but ridiculously expensive.
* The Realmship can travel at an undisclosed but fast speed. Some basic calculations using comments in the books suggest we are talking at some orders of magnitude faster than 10^18 times the speed of light, and they do not need to speed up or slow down, and can withstand several blows from an eternal emperor,  who is 2 levels above being able to destroy a solar system sized world. Can be used in personal combat, as shown in the books.
* The Decimatus Wave can destroy the universe. Mostly by running it over since it is the size of a realmverse. Designed to drain energy from a Chaosverse, hastening a heat death. Call it a multiverse killing weapon
* Other examples include the grassland world, a prison, and the worldsetting stele, a last ditch attack.
* This tech can go toe to toe with all the but the highest tier cultivation level from this world. The highest tier being high multiverse level

Vehicles Knowledge and Skills
Does not physically exist, is database, knowledge abilities, etc.


-Black Thumb (Mad Max) (100CP)
You have the skills of an expert mechanic, able to keep vehicles running even in the most inhospitable conditions. Repairing and tuning up engines is your bread and butter, even while they’re still operating. You also have a feel for how to upgrade cars in more esoteric ways; hey, it takes skill to add that many spikes and not hurt the handling!


-Titan Engineering (Titanfall) (100CP)
Titans are incredibly complex machines, and due to the disposable nature of their use and production, and not designed for easy repair. You've got the deft touch though, and know exactly where to tweak and shore up the structure to keep it purring like it's fresh out of the drop pod for years.


-Aerospace Engineering Makes Things Go Fast (Kerbal Space Program) (100CP)
You have an intuitive grasp on the mechanics of wind-flow, material sciences, atmospheric drag, tensile strengths, rocketry, so on and so forth, and how it applies to the art of designing vehicles that traverse the sky and space.


-Mechanic (Fast and Furious) (100CP)
 Machines, especially ones that go fast, just speak to you. You have no problem fixing up and tuning any motor vehicle, and can rebuild them after the most devastating crashes. You can keep anything in top condition with just a few simple tools. Of course, you also need to understand the electronics, so hotwiring cars (and sometimes, alarm systems) is not a problem either.




-Manifold Destiny (Subnautica) (100CP)
You’ve got one job, and you’re pretty good at it. The things you build have extra hull integrity, giving you more leeway when constructing habitats. Vehicles you construct have more advanced armor, making them harder to hurt without sacrificing acceleration


-This Looks Like Every Other Spaceship I Don’t Know How To Fly (Schlock Mercenary Rebuild) (100CP)
Except it turns out, you can. You are able to work out at least basic controls for any vessel instantly, and can very quickly familiarize yourself to the point of being able to fly through a busy battlefield. This can extend to figuring out how to ride strange animals.


-Vehicular skills (Generic Zombie Apocalypse) (200CP)
In addition to being a frankly amazing mechanic, you're also great behind the wheel you can avoid any avoidable accidents, you're quite apt at upgrading vehicle into mobile death machine


-Anaheim Degree (Gundam UC) (200CP)
You have the knowledge (and the paper to prove it to people and shove in their faces to establish superiority) of how to build MS. It’s trickier than it looks, honestly. Weight balances, servo designs, energy reserves- it’s all down to a science and you know how to build the basics. Who knows what you can learn from a bit of hands-on training…
* MS = Mobile Suits


-Techy (Code Geass) (250CP)
From Knightmares to guns, you know how to build and improve Geass tech


-Valuable Memories (Big O) (300CP)
 You have knowledge related to any particular concept-the construction of Megadei, the nature of memories, Bigs, or the creation of chimeras. Paradigm will have a vested interest in you, and will protect you and provide you with funds if you work for them.
* Three different skills the construction of Megadei, the nature of memories, Bigs, the creation of chimera should we separate them. 






-I Like 'Em Big | Could Stand To Lose A Few Pounds (Gundam AGE) (400CP)
I like 'Em Big (200CP): Your pace continues into your preferences in MS design-along with some basic knowledge of ‘Right, so I take this bolt out and everything falls to pieces without it. Don’t touch it.’ in your head, you can make upgrades to Mobile Suits that revolve around extra armoring and utility- making replacement parts cheaper and easier to install, reinforcing plates and glass, and generally making a unit tankier and sturdier.
Could Stand To Lose A Few Pounds (200CP) : When it’s out in the cold expanses of space (away from that damn plotradiation), nothing counts more to you than having a well-toned machine. With some basic knowledge of ‘Alright, I can’t make this any thinner or it snaps like stressed knockoff plastic’, you can make upgrades to Mobile Suits that shed crucial weight, making them faster, sleeker and more humanlike in motion- cutting what you can and generally making things more able to dodge, bob and weave.
* Only really useful for MS construction
* Could extend to other forms of media?


-Technical Certainties (Ace Combat) (400CP)
Some engineers are always second guessing themselves, sticking to maintenance of machines that others use. You're so sure of your skills that you're capable of altering fighter planes to great effect, making them noticeably better than they were fresh out of the factory. Upgrades will be easy provided you have resources, and your technical prowess will ensure your plane can serve whatever role you wish of it. You could even slave the controls of ground weapons to your computers, becoming a conductor of war from the skies. You might even be knowledgeable enough to build the next superweapon...


-Field Meister (Five Star Stories) (400CP)
Ordinary Meisters have sponsors and workshops lined with tools and mortar headdscraps. After all, that’s their job –to build and tune the mortar he adds which form the backbone of literally every single army in the Joker Cluster. Naturally, they’re highly demanded –especially the ones whohave made a name for themselves. You’re not quite there yet, but whereas others have fame, you have talent. While no one will say it to you outright, in reality a lot of people are rather envious of your abilities as a Meister. Perhaps your lack of obfuscating memories made it earlier for you to adapt to the necessary qualities to become one –but your potential as a Meister is so strong that you could tune and repair a MH even in the middle of a battlefield with nothing other than a plasma torch and some scrap metal. Frankly, you could probably rig up a temporary workshop just with stray tools lying about –but it’s probably best not to tempt fate by setting up permanent shop in the middle of the battlefield! 


-Chip and Dale’s Protege (Kingdom Hearts) (400CP)
If you’re going to sell your wares to the people of different worlds you’ll need a way to reach them and that way is the Gummi Ship. Composed of special Gummi blocks with unusual properties, a Gummi Ship is able to navigate the corridors between worlds and now you know how to build and maintain them. You can design and balance Gummi ships for your preferred mix of offense, defence, manoeuvrability, and even appearance with ease, and the ships you make tend to work a fair bit better than they otherwise might have. You can also identify components that would work well with Gummi ships, such as weapons or engines and how to integrate them.


-Runaway Cart (Donkey Kong Country) (400CP)
From mine carts to rockets sleds to other things that shouldn’t make for reliable transportation, you have a way of getting different potential vehicles to work for you.  Furthermore, you can enhance the capabilities of your “vehicle” in several ways.  First, you can get it to start moving just by hopping into it, and once you get it into motion you can ensure that it stays in motion for as long as possible instead of slowing down and stopping when it normally would.  Second, you can get it to continue to move as if on a stable track even when you are not on one at all.  For instance, you could have a mine cart or roller coaster car continue to move forward smoothly off its actual track.  Third, you can make the vehicle move in ways that would normally be impossible for it, such as making a mine cart literally jump into the air.  Fourth, the vehicle you are riding gains an enhanced degree of protection such that even an incredible volatile rocket barrel could survive at least a few separate headlong crashes into walls and other things before blowing up.


-Most Holy Order of the Socket Wrench (Fast and Furious) (400CP) 
You are a master mechanic. Repair and upkeep is nice, but you can go beyond the impossible and improve any vehicle. Take a van and make it beat a supercar? Put NOS injectors on a bicycle (and make it work)? How bout something challenging? And anything you can build up you can tear down, too. You're a one-man chop shop and wiring a car to explode takes but a few moments and some chicken wire.




-A new age of warfare (Metal Gear Solid) (600CP)
 Metal Gear, a weapon capable of bringing an entire nation to its knees (in theory) your engineering talents have extended to the point you can create these war machines, even automate them with AI, provided you have enough time and resources. with box-tech you can also invent things like man-portable railgun and stealth camo.


-Mechanical Genius (Clone Wars) (600CP)
 You're the leading expert at designing droids and starships. Given the right resources you could create fully autonomous starfighters with built in hyperdrives, battle droids with cheap, stronger and longer lasting shields, hover tanks as fast as landspeeders, androids indistinguishable from organics, and combat droids capable of killing jedi.
* This would be potentially setting breaking for the jump it came from with sufficient resources.


-Always a Bigger Robot (Gurren Lagann) (600CP)
The design and maintenance of epic machines is your specialty. You can figure out how to build starships measuring several kilometers long or devise a way to make a mountain sized mecha. You'll also have no problems getting past all the laws of physics that should make such creations impossible, perhaps Spiral Energy has something to do with it? 


-Tech Mastermind (Lost Planet) (600CP)
You know the insides of almost every VS and the guts of all your weaponry, and can fix them up to full standard and even beyond basic stuff like patching armor-hell, weld 2 VS together, I’m sure you’ll make something great out of it. You also can make just about any sort of technology or weaponry VS-compatible, and you can-with much, much strife-do the difficult task of working on Harmonizer technology 


-PT Theory | Alpha Documents (Super Robot Wars OG) (700CP)
PT theory 101 (100CP) : You've been around robots long enough to know the basics behind their engineering, at least in regards to the structure and reasoning behind the more common mechs, including the Earth Federation's standard Gespensts, and the TLI's Grungust Type 1: the example of the average Super Robot. Weapon knowledge also included in regards to both, which is basically ballistics and some small degree of beam weaponry. 
Alpha Documents (600CP) : The whole kit-and-caboodle of the Earth Federation's current research, all in your head (or documented physically/digitally, your choice). Highlights include: the T-Link System to enhance psychic capability, the Black Hole Engine and the Gravicon system involve the manipulation of gravity for both energy and combat usage, the Tesla Drive: a device capable of enabling flight in battleships that can also be miniaturized to allow robots to fly, and the other systems and engineering for the Gespensts up to the MKIII "Alteisen" and MKIV "Weissreiter", the Huckebeins up to the Mark III, the Grungusts up to Type 3, and the Lion series models up to the Astelion. Of course some of this does require EOT resources, so you may be limited in what you can do when you don't have these resources, you might be able to substitute them with the right materials, given time and research. 


-Consummate Knowledge | Swiss Army Engineer (Ring of Red) (700CP)
Consummate Knowledge (100CP) You know everything there is to know about repairing, maintaining, and fueling AFWs. This includes a working knowledge of diesel engines, pneumatic systems, ranged and melee weapon systems, among others.
Swiss Army Engineer (600CP) Most AFWs are designed by whole teams of engineers spending months, if not years, getting all the complicated systems to work together just right. But you can do it all on your own. You know how to build all AFW types from the ground up and don't have to worry about all the tedious fine-tuning most do. With further research and some time, you're confident that you can incorporate weaponry from other Jumps, albeit in a grungy, era-appropriate way.




-Fine Tuning | MT Engineering | AC Engineering | Core Competence (Armored Core Classic) (1800CP)
Fine Tuning (100CP) : A good mechanic can tune AC parts for better performance in specific areas. You're skilled at customizing them even further, at the cost of worsening some other characteristic; you can do things like modify boosters to use extra power for extra speed, or reinforce armor at the expense of added weight 
MT Engineering (400CP) : Theoretical and practical knowledge of MT design, construction and programming. Simpler machines than ACs and much more suitable for mass production, they're the workhorse of megascale construction and the backbone of security and military forces. Your skills could earn a pretty cushy job at any of the megas. Being giant robots, these need literal tons of material and lots of labor to make. You could contract out for construction, but the simplest use for this is to design MTs for some corp instead. Also, this perk alone doesn't make you good enough to design or build really top-of-the-line MTs, the kind that might rival ACs. 
AC Engineering (400CP) : Like MT Engineering, but for ACs and any associated equipment, from weapons to radar systems. ACs are all built for combat. They're modular in design and thus very versatile, and their specs let an AC match a small army of average MTs in the hands of the right pilot 
Core Competence (900CP) :  You are one of the world's best mech engineers; the corporations would literally kill to have you on payroll. High-performance MTs that compete evenly with ACs are now feasible- these are a bit cheaper and simpler to build than ACs, at the cost of far less customizability. Or, with even more work- probably most of your time in this jump- you might even come up with some sort of next-gen AC that chumps fellow ACs the way ACs chump their MT predecessors. Just don't expect to walk away from the job easily... that non-compete clause is murder

-Personal IS (Infinite Stratos) (0CP)
All players get a free Infinite Stratos Mecha personalised to them. See the Infinite Stratos section after the Item section for details on how to create this mecha
* Build your own Infinite Stratos in the Jump Document.


-Personal Knightmare Frame (Code Geass) (0CP)
Build your own Knightmare Frame, it is half the jump document, so I am not copying it all here.


-Nice Bike (Ghost Rider) (0CP)
You have a nice motorcycle; it’s top of the line, and decorated to your tastes. If you’d like, you can import another vehicle for 100 CP, giving it a motorcycle alt-form while also translating its capabilities. Comes with a matching helmet… not that you’d need one. If you’d prefer, you can turn your vehicle into a horse instead. How do light speed movement, cloaking, and missiles translate onto a horse? Hell if I know.


-Valkyrie Core & Frame (Battle Action Harem Highschool Side Character Quest) (0CP)
All origins possess a Valkyrie Frame with the accompanying core. A Valkyrie Core is capable of storing, integrating, and improving technology and equipment. Its only limitations are storage capacity and complexity both of which grow with hours synced. Your initial storage and complexity is based on your origin with more experienced origins having more. The term Valkyrie Frame usually refers to core that has integrated a suit of enhanced power armor that has been equipped with thrusters, weapons, and other equipment. Technology foreign to this universe is harder to integrate and upgrade. Post jump this limitation disappears.
* Fait based ability to improve technology integrated with the limitations of storage and complexity able to be at least partially solved via other perks in the forge


-Hangar (Ace Combat) (50CP) 
Planes are fine when they’re going through the air and dealing with enemies. But leaving them to the elements and the outdoors when they’re not in use? Well that just seems really crass. You need somewhere to store your vehicles and planes when you’re not busy destroying anything that’s not on your side, and that’s what these establishments are for. It’s not the most fancy thing in the world, but it’ll serve its purpose and make sure your means for vehicular slaughter are in prime condition for their tasks. For an additional +50CP, these hangar bays also come equipped with special clamps and harnesses to make refitting and refueling any planes, go much more quickly than they would if you were using them by hand. For sea-based bases, this also means you have docks for boats and submarines.
* Gives a WH attachment for planes, vehicles, boats, submarines. A very all encompassing storage space that keeps the vehicles stored in prime condition too. 


-Garage (Fast and Furious) (100CP) 
You have a nice garage and parts supply. With a few days and some elbow grease, you could basically rebuild your car or cars from the bottom up; you probably have enough parts to keep someone else's ride running or give it an upgrade, too.
* Gives spare parts for any level of ‘car’ and the ability to upgrade any level of car too, might also have a time acceleration component though not so sure about that.


-AeroChaser Speeder Bike (Star Wars KotOR) (100CP)
A small, fast hover bike built for a single pilot. Somewhat difficult to control. Faster than a basilisk war droid. Cannot be stored in starfighters.


-Magic Boat (Kane Chronicles) (200 CP)
A magical, flying boat that can transverse the Duat with relative ease, making taking an extra-dimensional shortcut significantly easier. In future settings, it can access other adjacent dimensions as well. Its ability to do so safely, on the other hand, is very much up to you.


-Mechanical Bird (Haoun and the sea of story) (200CP)
 Every Water Genie has his or her own steed to travel about between Earth and Kahani.  Choose any bird or flying thing, or even something mythical with wings - it could even be a strange, unique mix of your own invention, like a bird with a snake head and a peacock’s tail.  You gain a robotic version of that bird, which will loyally serve you and help you fly.  It can travel at high speeds easily, and communicate with its rider telepathically such as to not alter its aerodynamics.  Unlike many mechanized things, these constructs actually have very lively, passionate personalities.  Although it will shut down if its brain-box is removed, with the right technical know-how you can repair it easily.


-Sweet Ride (Ben 10) (300CP)
A muscle car that’s been upgraded with alien tech. It’s equipped with a variety of weapons and other useful upgrades like an invisibility cloak and a tachyon transceiver for picking up alien transmissions (among other things).


-Rust Bucket (Ben 10) (300CP)
You own a replica of Max Tennyson's motorhome. Do not let apperances fool you, this vehicle has been kitted out with upgrades like thrusters, laser turrets, and a plasma cannons, just to name a few.


-Aurek-Class Tactical Strikefighter (Star Wars KotOR) (300CP)
A durable republic starfighter 9 meters long and armed with twin laser cannons and proton torpedoes, able to carry a single pilot. Comes equipped with a hyperdrive, cargo space, and some supplies.


-Zombot (Plants Vs Zombies) (300CP)
​This is the Zombot, an enormous robot which can be piloted by you or anyone you designate from the controls in its head. It’s enormously strong, easily capable of lifting small vans and tossing them about, and has significant Pyrokinetic and Cryokinetic powers. Finally, this robot is also very light, easily capable of standing on the roof of your average suburban house without causing any significant damage. Unless you want to, that is.


-Spaceship (Iron Sky) (300CP)
A genuine Vrilian spaceship! This is a huge, plant-like starship with FTL capabilities, unlimited fuel and full databanks holding the sum total of Vril Knowledge. It also has massively powerful beam weaponry mounted on the front, ready to blast any enemies into smithereens for you. Unlike the original, this can be flown by humans too. Just like the original, even one person can fly it with no loss in functionality.


-Dynamic-class Freighter (Star Wars KotOR) (400CP)
This thing is basically an unmodified version of the “Ebon Hawk”. It comes with a hyperdrive, weapons, cargo space, supplies, and enough room/amenities to carry about eight average sized humanoids, plus some droids. The ship can be flown by a single person but you’ll need at least a co-pilot if you want to use the powerful laser turrets on this thing, or have someone help navigate while you try to avoid blaster fire and other hazards.


-Flying Bike(Injustice) (400CP)
Now, you aren’t anywhere near as wimpy as any of the bastiches native to this universe. And that means you ride around in style where all the rest of them don’t. To be specific – your preferred mode of transit is a flying motorbike, capable of travelling at FTL speeds when it needs to and damn near indestructible – it can ram straight through buildings with no negative effects to its function whatsoever. It also generates a field around its user protecting them from the harshness of vacuum, as well as room for one passenger and substantial amounts of cargo space. Can be decorated in your style – so that whenever people see it, they’ll know that you’re on the prowl.




-Resupply Ship/Fog Warships (Arpeggio of Blue Steel) (400CP)
An autonomous resupply ship that gathers materials to re-arm Fog vessels. It has no ability to fight on its own, but is capable of filtering nanomaterials from sea water (on an industrial scale) and mining heavier elements from the sea floor or beaches. Using these materials, it can manufacture missiles, gun rounds, and other expendable weaponry, as well as provide some ability to refit Fog ships (so long as the repairs don’t require a dry dock). It has a non-sentient Union Core. With some modification, it could resupply and repair other types of ships besides Fog Vessels.
Fog warships are advanced, more like starships than seafaring vessels. Built of nanomaterials, they can change their shape and structure when needed, though they seem to prefer the shapes of WWII-era ships. For example, their turrets instead of holding normal cannons instead house photon cannons, or their hulls open to fire their super graviton cannons. Ships comprised of nanomaterials must be controlled by a Union Core, or similarly advanced computer system. If purchased by a human, or as a second ship by Mental Models, these vessels are run by a Union Core (free) which does not currently have a Mental Model.
* This one seems different from the other kinds of  Fog ships, focused more on supply, repair, ability to modify ships and manufacturing of ammo and nanomaterials for use. I suggest this and the Unusual Class to be left behind




-An Unusual Class (Arpeggio of Blue Steel) (400CP)
Import a previous sea-faring vessel as a Fog battleship. It retains its previous qualities and weaponry, but becomes made of nanomaterials, able to change its form and is capable of mounting Super-Weapon Systems. You may choose whether it retains its previous sea-faring shape, or gains an alt-form based on a WWII warship.


-Ship Girl Conversion Kit | Equipment Boxes (Azur Lane) (600CP)
Ship Girl Conversion Kit (400CP) Hmm, Jumper, you already have a naval vessel? Well, why not turn it into a Ship-girl? This handy little box can be attached to any Navy ship you personally own, wherein it will grow to envelop the vessel. Over a course of time relative to the size of the ship, this device will transform the vessel into a Ship-girl of an appropriate physique compared to the rough size of the vessel being transformed. For example, the SR2 Normandy might be a Destroyer, and an Imperial-Class Star Destroyer would be analogous to a Battleship. And yes, to be perfectly clear, this Item works on any “vehicle” that belongs to a Navy, on water or in Space. So yes, the Death Star would count too. Your new Ship-girl will become a Companion, with a personality fitting the background of her original builders. Continuing with the analogy, the Star Destroyer would be imperious and serious, while an Apocalypse Class Battlecruiser from Warhammer 40K would be devoutly faithful and xenophobic. Your new Ship-girl will retain her full array of weaponry and power, just in a human-sized frame... This is terrifying, why am I offering you this?
Equipment Boxes (200CP) Because gear, equipment, and upgrade materials for your Ship-girls is half the battle of making them stronger. Upon purchase of this Item you will receive a randomized shipment of ten boxes every week ranging in rarity from 1 to 5, with 5 being the highest tier of gear. While tier 5 gear is the rarest, this purchase guarantees you at least 1 tier 5 box every month. Post-Jump this tier list will scale to your overall power level, with tier 1 becoming your baseline.


-Lagann-type Gunman (Gurren Lagann) (400CP)
Despite only standing about as tall as the average human adult, the Lagann mechs have the potential to be the most powerful Gunmen in the galaxy. 
Drill Generation (0CP)  You can create drills of different sizes on any part of the mech. These drills can be used as weapons, tools, or shields. The potential of this power is only as great as your Spiral Energy.
Lagann Impact (0CP)  You're able to combine with other mechs and vehicles by drilling into them and then using the physic defying power of Spiral energy to force a transformation that assimilates your target into your mech. The potential of this power is only as great as your Spiral Energy.
Flight Capabilities(0CP)  Soar through the air on jets. Speed and range increase with your Spiral Energy levels


-Delorean DMC-12 (Back to the Future) (400CP)
A luxury car that, on hitting 88 miles per hour, will transport you through time to the date and time entered on the dash control. Helpfully has a Mr. Fusion to power the time circuits, and a 2015 flight conversion. If you’d prefer something wilder yet less iconic, you can make yours a tricked-out locomotive. 


-Shipyard (Honor Harrington) (400CP)
Well, look who struck big! This is a full-fledged Orbital shipyard, capable of making any and all ships you have the knowhow of making. It is automated to the absolutely maximum degree, and what remains is taken care of by an NPC crew of expert technicians who are not and may never become companions. It creates the resources to build both ships and space stations ex nihilo, generating enough to build one Manticoran Superdreadnought every three months.
It updates automatically, creating new docks of whatever sizes are needed as you acquire or design new schematics and technology, along with generating any materials required. Except, that is, for any super-rare materials, which are generated at a much more reduced pace, enough to create a single ship using them in about an year.
In future worlds, too, it automatically updates with whatever parts and materials are required to build any starships or other space constructions that you know how to build. In case building a starship absolutely requires sapient people, it generates NPCs with the requisite capabilities.


-FABRICARIA (The Culture Minds) (400CP)
Do you like building things? If so, I have a bargain for you. A whole lot of small manufacturing stations in orbit around a gas giant, each a disc a couple of kilometers wide. Roughly 200 million of them, actually. The utility of this excessive number of automated constructors will vary by what blueprints are loaded into them. Each fabricator station burns out once the matter and energy it stores is used up; each of them could produce a warp-capable starship around a kilometer long in under a week, but these ships barely rate the term – about CL 5 at best. Still, numbers might count when they’re all firing their missiles. In future jumps, the Fabricaria will follow you to new worlds and be placed in orbit around the nearest gas giant, and the Fabricaria are reset at the start of each jump.


-Chop Shop (Ben 10 0.1) (400CP)
Alright, you got the car. Now you need someplace to put it and fix it up when somebody inevitably wrecks it. You’ve got your own little garage full of everything you need to fix and maintain vehicles you own, as well as stuff like weapons and little gizmos. Even if you’ve got some advanced alien technology nobody else has, the tools you need to fix it up can be found here as long as it’s nothing super rare or unique. Car? Easy. Laser rifle? Pick up that welder and get on it. No matter what it is, you can bring in just about anything to this chop shop and find the tools needed to fix it. Only downside is that it’s not really great for things like big battleships or stuff the size of a building...it’s just the size of a normal garage, after all


-The Factory  (9) (400CP)
Your very own version of The Machine’s factory, an immense industrial complex designed to be operated by the Machine. The Factory is primarily designed to produce and supply the Steel Behemoths that The Machine was originally assigned to create, and which it used to eventually wipe out all life on Earth. This item contains all the machinery needed to create the parts needed to create the Behemoths, as well as all the fuel and ammunition. It also generates all of these, allowing for the creation of 1 Behemoth per day while generating enough parts, ammunition, and fuel to supply up to 100 constantly active Behemoths. With the right expertise, you can even reconfigure The Factory to create and support some other construct of a similar scale. If you supply it with the right materials, you can easily upscale the production capacity of The Factory. Much like The Machine’s factory, this includes a harness for an AI core complete with arms that end in all manner of manipulators and tools.
* A factory that generates effectively infinite fuel, parts & ammo for 30ft warmachines, this is really useful


-Type 40 Time Travel Capsule (Doctor Who) (400CP)
 Ah. Well now, this is what it was all for, innit? Congratulations, you are the proud owner-belonging-partner of an ancient, obsolete, outdated thing stored in the basement of a Time Lord Museum. 
Well, that and one of the two most advanced ships in existence, once all the other versions get locked up behind a Time Lock. This is a TARDIS, Time and Relative Dimensions In Space. It’s the most advanced piece of Space/Time technology ever created, and it... maybe he/her, who knows, is all yours! This is a completely sapient, fifteen-dimensional ship that can range anywhere from the size of a small briefcase to Jupiter on the outside, while remaining a constant size on the inside. And that constant size is ‘infinite’. Yup. 
There is no limit to how large it can get on the inside, how many rooms, corridors, libraries or pools it can have. It’s capable of massive, ridiculous manipulations of time and space, the simplest, of course, being moving through it willy-nilly. Seriously, sky’s the limit here. You can go anywhen between the Big Bang and the heat death of the universe, and anywhere in or outside the universe you have coordinates for. That’s mostly what it does on the outside. 
On the inside it can do anything and everything you can imagine regarding Time and Space. It also has fabricators capable of producing virtually anything, an instance of the Eye of Harmony powering it, massive libraries, fully functional Chameleon and Translation circuits, a state of temporal grace that prohibits weapons from being fired inside without your permission, and all the other bells and whistles you’ve ever seen in the other Type 40 you know about. And unlike that one, this one is in perfect working order. Honestly, who steals their new ride from a repair shop? 
Just about everything about this ship can change for the sake of utility and to be pleasing to you... and itself, of course. It retains all improvements, recovers flawlessly from any damage done to it in less than a second, and won’t blow up the universe if the impossible happens and it gets destroyed. 
Also, no matter how often or with what you try and look into the Time Vortex it’s simply not going to work until after you’ve gotten your Spark. Before then you’re not getting any naughty lupines, period.
* Premium time lord tech


-Worldship (GALACTA DAUGHTER OF GALACTUS) (400CP)
The very most sweetest of rides in the cosmos. The Worldship here, Taa III, is a spare that Galactus made way back. He never said it was for you explicitly but you reckoned he wouldn’t mind terribly if you took it for a joyride for a few centuries. The worldship is a magnificent thing, large enough to encapsulate an entire solar system and hold stars in it’s gravitational pull with ease. It’s not just huge but also one of the most powerful and speed ships in the cosmos, given it’s handmade to be a worthy vessel by and for Galactus himself. The worldship will only listen to commands from him or you and contains a vast arsenal and database of weaponry and technology made by your father, even featuring many things beyond your own limits technologically. Also contained within are vast planet sized biomes filled with seemingly endless zoos of alien creatures. The ship is easy to control, being linked to your mind, and cloaking it from all manners of detection is as simple as commanding it to be so. It can even prevent its own gravitational pull from activating, in case you wanted to part it next to Earth. Since Taa III isn’t like the original exactly, you don’t need to have it share the same shape as Taa II. You may import a ship into this option.


-Bilgewater Star Galleon (dinotopia) (400CP)
A copy of the ships anchored in the landlocked town of Bilgewater.  The locals, descendants of proud sailors who challenged the Spanish Armada, rebuilt their trio of ships and fused them together, their bows pointing upward.  However unlikely it may seem, these ships are capable of flight and even space travel, with those traveling aboard remaining safe throughout the voyage.  Moreover, the ships, serving as lifeboats for when dark days return and Earth should strike a reef and sink, begin to lift whenever they sense danger, the level of movement correlating to the level of danger.


-Dimensional Warship (Lyrical Nanoha) (400CP)
Ohohoho, what do we have here? It’s a fully functional warship fresh from the docks of the Bureau, and its ready for its maiden voyage. It can be any model of TSAB ship that isn’t a MacGuffin or an experimental prototype, and has the ability to cross dimensions on its own, along with basic FTL travel. The downsides being that you can only cross dimensions in this particular world, or what passes for a ‘local multiverse’ in future jumps - which it may not always be able to do if one doesn’t exist. Post-Spark, this ship can visit past jumps and entirely new worlds as well. This requires a crew to fly - you’ll have to gather one or find a way to fly it on your own. I recommend picking a smaller vessel class if this is a problem. 


-A 300 Frame (Battle Action Harem Highschool Side Character Quest) (500CP)
Wait what? You somehow manage to acquire one of the legendary 317 frames that were found with preinstalled weapons and equipment that vastly outstrips what is currently in use by the UN. While the gear of the 300 frames slowly upgrades identically overtime across all frames, it is essentially fixed and the frames are incapable of integrating anything new. Though pilots that have used the 300 frames refer to the personality of their Valkyrie Cores as cold an impersonal compared to their regular Valkyrie Cores which seem to develop a personality with use. 


-Proto-TRUK (Ben 10) (600CP)
What appears to be a truck belonging to a local plumbing company can transform into a highly advanced faster-than-light spaceship. Comes equiped with a Tri-Blaster Turret and a holding cell for prisoners.






-Fraxinus (Date a Live) (600CP)
An airship that belongs to Ratatoskr, it maintains an altitude of 15 kilometers above the city, with the ability to <<Cloak>> from view and <<Avoid>> any other fliers through the use of its Realizer. You have been gifted with a perfect copy of the Fraxinus, this floating, invisible operation base for Ratatoskr. As well armed as the original. If destroyed or lost it will reappear the next day, completely unscratched. Don’t worry about maintenance or fuel, unless you tweak it too much.


-Goetia (Date a Live) (600CP)
 The giant,floating ship of DEM, created to aid the ‘Wizards’, it’s controlled by a user with a special CR-Unit and various A.I. in the ship. Armed with several cannons, capable of deploying the most advanced energy shields around and pretty much self-repairing. Wherever the one you have is the same as DEM owns or a perfect copy is up to you.


-Dragonzord (Power Rangers) (600CP)
An ancient giant robotic ally from the sea. It has plenty of built in weaponry such as drills and missiles for you to use. You can pilot it remotely using the dragon dagger or take control from within the cockpit. It can combine with other dinozords for more power.


-AGE System (Gundam AGE) (600CP) 
This is a 3-part package deal, so you’re getting more bang for your buck. First is the AGE Device, which is a massive data-storage unit that contains the Asuno’s research data (though for you it starts only with what Flit managed to create and gather before the series start) and the blueprints for the Gundam’s armor. It also acts as a key-none of the other parts of this system will operate without it. Next is the AGE Builder, which is an extremely fast 3-D printer (able to make a Mobile Suit rifle in seconds) and continuously collects data from the AGE Device and AGE System. The AGE System is a data collection program that can be installed onto a Mobile Suit and acts as a unique OS. It will collect data and evolve along with its pilot, researching ‘solutions’ to problems, coming in the form of the Wear Parts, arm and legs designed to improve and counter situations. The Wear Parts are flown to the AGE Gundams in battle using the AMEMBO (one of which is included with this purchase) and swapped mid-battle, though with a different design you could remove the AMEMBO from the equation entirely. This is a highly advanced system, one that can collect, analyze, improve, build and conquer many situations. A Mobile Suit equipped with the AGE System will have a bright letter on its front, defaulting to a blue ‘A’-as a bonus, you may change the coloring and the letter to whatever you wish at any time.
* A evolving, adaptable mech and research data




-Interceptor (Green Lantern the Animated Series) (800CP)
The Interceptor is an experimental prototype spacecraft powered by a giant lantern battery & is potentially the fastest vehicle ever created. It’s armed with a powerful energy gun system & is equipped with a navigational computer containing an artificial intelligence. The Interceptor is outfitted with the power of ultra-warp. When activated the Interceptor enters an ultra-warp field & can travel billions of light years in seconds. By placing your ring into the console you're able to create energy constructs like it was a giant power ring, but it's incredibly tiring to do so for more than a few seconds. Lastly you're able to recharge your ring through the giant lantern battery, but if you're not careful it can blow off your arm! The AI you have aboard is L.A.N.O.S, whom is incapable of feelings & doesn't count as a companion. His programmed in voice is a chipper male persona who is programmed to always sound happy & upbeat. He is unable to break his programming, at least without help and will always defer to your command and rarely take actions into its own "hands".


-"Extensive Research Notes" (White Knight Chronicles) (1200CP)
Not a modification to your Knight itself, no. This is instead a pile of research journals filled with numerous notes and schematics detailing the processes behind the creation and modification of Knights, Knight Weapons and Knight's Arcs. The journals mention an ancient school of magic used to craft these weapons of war, but it bears a heavy resemblance to another school that seems very familiar... 




-Mind|Energy Form|The Sublimed (The Culture Minds) (2100CP) 
Mind (800CP) You're now an ovoid shape between 10m and 20m in length and around 2-2.5m in width, but only your outer envelope is in real space–-you're a lot bigger on the inside. A “naked” mind like you weighs around fifteen thousand tons.  You can utilize hyperspace to perform truly astronomical calculations and contain several field generators, backup power sources, and communication systems just in case.  While your internal warp unit is supposed to be used for processing, it can be jury-rigged to allow low-grade FTL travel in a pinch.  Should worst come to worst, you can self-destruct either with minimum force (a blast around one kiloton) or maximum force (enough power to crack a planet in half and toast hostile ships nearby).
Energy Form (300CP) Your “body” is a pattern of energy in the energy grid, providing you with vast amounts of power and the closest thing to immortality without becoming fully Sublimed. This asset allows you to use incredible control of electromagnetic fields to interact with and project an image into the physical world, though you do not actually exist within it. Extruding a part of yourself “up” (or “down”) into the material universe is an effect very similar to gridfire, a raw manifestation of incredible energy.  Despite your mastery of energy, this hypergrid intrusion cannot be sustained for long. As a product of electromagnetic forces, any of your projections or manipulations of the physical world are (potentially) disruptable by forces that control or disrupt energy while the underlying pattern in the Energy Grid (your true “body”) may be able to be harmed by forces which themselves can affect or manipulate this hyperspatial aspect of the universe.
The Sublimed (1000CP) You have transcended conventional existence and taken up residence in several higher dimensions.  While the Optimae may deploy gridfire, you have the means to call up vast, boiling wavefronts of the energy grid that would annihilate entire fleets, erect Quiet Barriers to block hyperspatial travel around stars for light-years, and with the right technology travel between universes in the nested, expanding concentric-hypersphere of universes is possible.



----------------

Time




-Rapid Construction (Blazing Saddles) (50CP)
You are not only a truly excellent carpenter, you are an exceptionally fast worker. Any form of construction or crafting will be completed in a tenth the time it would otherwise take, though your overall quality will suffer if you use this at full effect (times ten). At times two, you’ll sacrifice none of the quality, but as you get closer to times ten, you’ll sacrifice more and more of it.


-Fixer (Smash Up) (100CP)
 You’re really good. All your repairs seem to take half as much time as normal. A true miracle worker.


-ACCIDENTALLY DROPPED MY GRAVITAS (Culture) (100CP) 
It's terribly serious business being a Ship, Mind or Hub, isn't it? Being responsible for your passengers, having to take care of Big Mind Business, handling all kinds of Ship-related emergencies that need reaction times down to the microsecond. Yet sometimes it's the simple things that make existence worth experiencing. You can always find time to really enjoy your hobbies or celebrations, no matter how trivial they might seem, and the weight of the responsibility on your shoulders can't crush your joyful and pleasant mood if you chose to have one. You can also drop into a whimsical, almost nonsensical persona at the drop of a hat, all the better to annoy much more serious people and Minds.


-Don't Need A Team (Ace Combat) (100CP)
Fighter planes are pretty complicated machines, and more often than not you need a whole crew to maintain them so that they don’t break down in the middle of a fight and doom the pilot. You know your plane well enough to circumvent this issue. You've got just the right idea on what needs tuning up and what needs fixing, along with having the speed to be able to fix a plane up by yourself without the need for a crew in a fraction of the time. Performance issues are a thing of the past for you.
 
-Time Flies (Lords Of The Night – Zombies)​ (200CP)
 There are many talented old wizards who have devoted decades of work to achieving immortality, and they didn’t even start that search until they were already skilled and experienced in their magic. And many of them fall short. You have a single decade. Good thing you can make the most of your time. 
Any kind of extended work or project you’re working on progresses unnaturally fast. Or at least, your contribution does. Specifically, it goes five times as fast. You can read a book five times as fast, set-up a ritual five times as fast, craft five times as fast, study or do research five times as fast, and so on.  
This never works on action or dynamic set pieces. You could do five days of ritual work in a single day, but the high point at the end of the ritual, the part that must not be interrupted least horrible consequences befall everyone? Normal time.  


-Short Development Time (Generic Video Game Developer) (200CP)
 Working at a smaller game company means that sometimes you get contracted out by a bigger corporation to make a game, and they want it ASAP. Well, at least now you can work fast enough to keep up with the deadlines. Usually, anyway. Either way, expect to do half again as much work as you would normally get done in the same span of time, all without losing any quality to your work!


-Hit a Key, Any Key (Generic Video Game Developer) (200CP)
 Your coding and typing speed is increased dramatically, with your average WPM speed easily being over 150, and with some practice getting up to over 200 won’t be much of a problem. What’s better is that you will now never mistype, meaning all words will be spelled as intended and you’ll never accidentally hit the wrong key. This will also boost you handwriting and drawing speed a good deal, although not quite as much as your typing ability.
* Removes human error from transcribing information.


-Assembly Line (Girl's Frontline) (200CP)
While in this world, you can spend resources (ammunition, rations, spare parts and man-hours) to make T-Dolls the normal way...OR you can do it the more fun way, by shoving said resources into a gacha and seeing what comes out the other side. This gives you less direct control of what comes out, but it does allow you to churn out large amounts of T-Dolls, as this method is several times faster than the norm. By paying 200 CP, you maintain this power in future jumps, and the available dolls will be inspired by/utilize local technology in their construction (as well as still having access to the canon ones, if you so wish).


-Machinist (Gargoyles) (200CP) 
You are an expert mechanic. You can rebuild and improve a helicopter in 12 hours or create a functional motorcycle from spare parts. If honed, this ability will let you make nearly anything from incredibly advanced robots to nanite swarms in only a few months time.


-Fast Service (Warhammer 40k: Squats) (200CP)
Some might wonder what place a mechanic has on the battlefield, but they clearly never saw a tank take a crippling hit. Fortunately, your skills are such that you can repair many vehicles and devices that would seem at first glance only good for parts, and in a fifth the normal time.


-Slacking Off (Generic Factory) (200CP)
You will always find some time where you can slack off while working without harming your performance. This doesn’t actually reduce the amount of time you need to be at work, just the amount of time you need to be doing work.


-Time to Cook (Wonderland No More) (200CP)
 Wonderland’s sense of time is kind of screwy, and it’s perfectly reasonable for a chef to go out for a midnight quest to a mountain for an egg and get back before the pot boils over.  This perk essentially slows down the progression of time from a narrative standpoint as long as you are focusing on making food – that includes everything from acquiring ingredients to preparing the food to setting the table.  This does not slow or freeze the movements of those around you, but it basically means that as long as you are focused on cooking, you’ll finish everything on time and nothing will interrupt you.  For instance, if you are cooking a special potion to boost your troops in time to stop an invasion, you’ll get the potion ready on time even if the siege was just an hour away.  When you stop doing food-related things, time returns to its normal pace; spell preparations technically count as “cooking” by Wonderland rules, though.


-Workaholic (Sonic) (300CP)
 Sometimes you wonder how some geniuses are able to build entire armadas within days or weeks of their last defeat. You become a walking factory of production. Building in masse is something that comes without issue to you. That one bot that took a week to build? Now that one bot is now 5. Or roughly 3x the size it was before. How do you even have the resources to build so much you say? The hell if I know.


-Manufacturing Line (Valkyria Chronicles) (400CP)
 You've always been of the opinion that technology advanced too slowly before you arrived, but now you can apply that to the physical world as well! Any building process you oversee, whether it be the forging of a sword or an entire tank factory, will now produce results twice as fast and with half the required materials used.


-Researcher (Age of Mythology) (400CP)
You are far faster at designing and discovering new technologies. Inspiration and breakthroughs hit you far more often.


-One-Man Industry (God Catching Meister) (400CP)
Despite being chained to the forge for hours on end, alchemists can make just a handful of works per day. Mixing, forging and enchanting take time and finesse, after all. Those who make items in masse tend to vomit works of low quality. In face of that, you trained and mastered the art of making things really quick without a loss in quality. About ten times as faster as your peers, in fact. While an alchemist with your same rank would take an hour to make a fire sword, you in the same span of time can make ten, and even give each different powers. This bleeds out to other aspects in your life. Time is money, after all.


-Wasteland Re-Builder (Modded Fallout) (400CP)
From hand-crafted bullets in the Mojave to entire settlements near Boston (and probably a gauntlet made from a dismembered Deathclaw’s… ah, claw) no matter where you are, going through Fallout means making stuff - and usually out of scraps lying around, too. You’re good at it, though. More than good, even. You now have a mental ‘build menu’ you can use to create or modify items, ranging from consumables or ammunition to infrastructure as large as an entire house. You’ll still need to know exactly what you’re building, of course, though the menu automatically updates to incorporate your skills and abilities (including whatever you can create from settings beyond Fallout). But perhaps the most amazing part of this power isn’t just that it gives you a quick and easy overview of what you can make (and what materials you’ll need)... but once you’re ready to actually get your hands dirty, the crafting process is nearly instantaneous. So yes, you can build a thousand .50 Match rounds or a small town’s worth of concrete fortifications in under a minute if you really felt the need.


-I Know What We're Going To Do Today (Phineas and Ferb) (400CP)
24 hours just doesn't seem like enough time to get stuff accomplished, but you'd be surprised what determination (and this perk) can get you. You can now complete days and even weeks worth of work in just a few hours, and this effect increases tremendously when you have a few helpers, to the point where a small team can work with you to complete years worth of work in a simple afternoon.


-Savvy Sultan (Macross) (400CP)
When people think of building things, they think of you. Provided you had the resources and the understanding of the technology, you could construct all manners of machines in a fourth of the time it would normally take. By yourself. You're no slouch with any of your tools either, wielding them with the precision of a machine with no loss of speed. Quality and a deadline? No problem.


-Magical Assembly (Generic Builder) (400CP) 
Rather than use tools for your building, you’ve learned how to assemble and disassemble things using magic. This increases your Building speed by half again.


-Under Pressure (Stargate Atlantis) (400CP)
Work that would take a whole team a week to do, you can do by yourself in a day...when you're properly motivated. Unfortunately that proper motivation involves imminent demise: a gun held to your head, an incoming blast of solar radiation, anything that would wipe you or your friends out. The closer your death approaches, the faster and better you work – just keep in mind that some tasks are too large for even your accelerated competency to complete.
* Do we really want this?
* It's nice to have improved abilities when in danger to pull through in a tough situation.


-Shipping the Product (F.E.A.R.) (400CP)
 Prototypes are one thing, but what about actually getting the damn thing distributed? An item or weapon doesn't help anyone if it's the only one of its kind. You will find your ability to create has increased dramatically in efficiency, letting you use the materials for three of the same items to actually make five while streamlining production lines rather quickly. As a bonus, logistics have increased enough where your shipped supplies are harder to intercept, keeping any allies you have fresh with resources!


-HIVE PROCESSING (Culture) (400CP)
Different to the way Culture Minds are made, your mind is a collective process of many (from hundreds to hundreds of thousands) of sub-minds running on a Very Fast Substrate. These sub-minds might themselves be artificial intelligences, copies of a singular Mind-State, or they might be a ‘population’ of uploaded bio minds all running at Mind speeds. Regardless, the collective output of these separate sub-minds still manages to be “you”. It is only natural, then, that you have a ludicrous ability to multitask even beyond that of regular Minds, able to remain aware and focused on a great many thousands to millions of inputs without sacrificing processing speed or power, and when considering a task with anything but the smallest amount of attention, your mind naturally analyses the problem from many different points of view. Anyone attempting to Compromise you has to Comp all of your sub-minds without the other sub-minds noticing and doing something about it.


-Heavengazer Tower MK.II (Desolate Era II) (400CP)
A far more advanced version of the Heavengazer Tower of Radiance, this version allows you to accelerate time up to a million times with no energy drain in you or the Chaosverse. The world on the inside is at the size of a Chaosworld, and any restrictions on food and sustenance being formed on the inside are now also gone.


-Arsenal Of Destruction (Galactic Civilisations II) (400CP)
 To build a fleet capable of defending your empire (or conquering a rival’s) is not a trivial task. Parts and resources need to be brought in from dozens of industrial sectors, crews and soldiers need to be trained, and there’s always the dilemma of what exactly you’ll go for - larger numbers of small combat craft, or a few, powerful warships to dominate one sector at a time. Or at least… it used to be. Streamlining your industrial capacity is not easy, but when it comes to military-industrial power your people are nothing short of savants. You’ll be able to build more ships, faster and cheaper than before… and most amazingly, this effect becomes more pronounced the greater your production target’s overall size, complexity, and cost are. Heavy Fighters’ small size means they don’t have that many ways to optimize production, but Frigates are already substantially easier, and Dreadnaughts? Well, by the time you’re building those behemoths you shouldn’t be surprised if you start getting almost twice as much bang for your buck. Possibly literally, if you like using missile weapons. 


-Build Rome (Gundam: After Colony) (600CP)
You have a thing about building things-you’re damn fast, and you’re damn good. They say you can’t build 10 Mobile Suits in a week? Hah! You’ll build twice that much and you’ll build them to last! You simply have utter talent in the way of making things quickly-enough to double production, maybe even triple production if you work at it enough, and they’ll come out with no loss of quality. In addition, these constructions will last-barring sudden disaster and similar, they’ll easily last several decades of constant abuse, and if they’re upkept and repaired they could even last centuries with no troubles.


-Fast-Charging (Heat Signature) (600CP)
Your rechargeable equipment recharges 225 times as fast. 24 hour recharge times become 16 seconds. This effects cell phones, laptops, etc. but it doesn’t give them a self-powering source. Objects cannot benefit from this while in active use (A laptop in sleep mode is not in active use, but is when mining bitcoin).


-Silken Mountainriver Diagram (Talisman Emperor Mortal Dimension) (600CP)​
This Immortal Artifact takes the form of a painting 52 picturing a verdant landscape with majestic mountains and rivers so lifelike that they appear to move. With a small amount of essence, a cultivator can enter the painting which expands to the size of a world. Time flows more swiftly inside the painting, allowing a year to pass when the outside world only experiences a single day. While plants and animals grow older accordingly, sapient beings still only age a single day, making it ideal for cultivation. The owner of the Silken Mountainriver Diagram can control who enters it, but cannot directly force them to exit it. Anything which can become an attachment to your Warehouse can instead be placed inside the Silken Mountainriver Diagram.  
* Only works up to a 365fold, which is worse then heavengazer tower, which is a million fold. Also much smaller. Can import properties, which might be nice.
* That importation allows you to put the tower and SCP-2400 nested within each other for a time dilation effect of 51.10 billion to one plus any other locations or items that alter time flow.


-SCP-2400 (SCP foundation) (600CP)
Wow, really? Alright, well, I guess you have an eye for the good stuff, then, even if it is just a chunk of concrete with a door on it. Inside this door is a blank, featureless, white expanse with no apparent limit, or defined edges, with unidentifiable, indestructible white, "ground," an atmosphere consistent with the terrestrial location of the object, and a star stuck at what appears to be twelve noon. When the door's open, time flows normally; when it's closed, however, time inside flows at one hundred and forty(140) seconds inside per second outside. The icing on the cake? There's no downside, aside from accelerated aging, and that doesn't affect you, now does it.


-Deus Vult (Youjo Senki) (600CP)
The creation of cutting edge technology is an odd process. Normally, it would be long hours of research and testing followed by tiny advances. You on the other hand, by some method, have been inspired. Your specialty lies in completely eschewing the normal methods in order to create prototype technology that far outpaces everything - in exchange for vast amounts of instability. If you manage to reign in your genius, and ego, creating something halfway between genius and the status quo will leave you with something more powerful, but also easier to mass produce.


-Seed of The Singularity (Generic Cyberpunk) (600CP)
They say that the future begins with an idea, but that’s not true. It begins when you make an idea reality. You’re not just someone that is content to fiddle the technology that’s already there, you’re one of the minds that could shatter everything we thought we knew. Your ability to innovate and invent is awe inspiring, doing the work of years in scant months. What you piece together in your lab to test a concept would count as a production model to anyone else, and your actual finalized designs are nothing short of pure brilliance. This applies just as well to actual discovery, burning through fields of testing and examination with incredible speed. Your work alone could build the entire future if you had the resources, and if you can survive the people who would kill for the things you can make.


-Technological Upgrade (World Seed) (600CP)
Spaceship captains, rulers of both kingdoms and planets alike, and people similarly reigning over the masses or in possession of a vast amount of land have access to a special kind of system in Neolife. A sort of management menu, it allows people to upgrade their territories in two kinds of ways: the first is a technology upgrade, which a ruler could use to add irrigation to a field, or to increase the defence of a city. If there is a design provided, it will be instantly built once the upgrade finishes in around a week.


-Clock of Ages(Chronicles of Narnia) (600CP)
An enormous mechanical clock attached to your Cosmic Warehouse. By precisely adjusting various gears and chains within this clock, you can control the rate that time flows in your warehouse relative to the world outside, to a maximum of twice as fast and a minimum of half as fast. For each Jump you've completed, increase this cap by 20%. After 5 jumps, you'll be able to speed things up to three times as fast or slow them down to 1/3. After 10 jumps, you'll be able to speed things up to four times as fast, and so on. If you've got any similar pocket dimensions, you might figure out a way to hook them up to the clock as well.
* Might be better to replace with temporal controls from PRS, if we want to keep something like this
* This one has the advantage that it upgrades for any jump you have completed. However, this is only useful if you plan to do a lot of jumps. To match temporal controls, you would need 40 jumps, and to match the upgraded sectional time, would need 490. This is also useful in that it can be linked to other pocket dimensions, such as ones already accelerated, to stack 


-Steel Driving Man (Generic Factory) (600CP)
Whenever you are working with a machine you find that you can always keep up with it, you can practically run an entire assembly line all on your own and still find time for a smoke break.
* Scales indefinitely allowing any machinery that can be operated to benefit from from perks that improve use of tools.




-One-Man Assembly Line (XCOM) (600CP)
You really liked playing with building blocks as a kid. Now that you're all grown up, the world is your playground. Your knowledge of construction and engineering is unprecedented, and making a jet engine from spare parts over a weekend is your idea of fun.


-Instant Construction (fallout 76) (600CP)
Rebuilding Appalachia will take quite a lot of time and effort, so let’s remove at least some of that. If you know how to build something, and have the resources available to you, you can consume those resources and snap that item into existence nearby you. You remove the time needed for construction, and the risk of manufacturing mistakes. However, you can only do this in areas that are either owned by you, or have no one else nearby to potentially contest your claim.


-Scientist: Machinery/Strong Spark (Girl Genius) (700CP) 
Scientist (100CP) You have a DOCTORATE! And skill in ACTUAL SCIENCE! That doesn’t need you to go crazy to work! Admittedly, it won’t break the fabric of space and time, but meh. Tradeoffs everywhere you go. You’re highly trained in one field, and can easily apply its principles to your work. After all, building a crazed abomination upon the natural order usually requires at least a smidgen of understanding of which bones are supposed to go where (Even if you end up changing them around a little). At the very least, you’re also in the genius range of standard intelligence. 
Strong Spark (600CP) Rather than having a weak Spark (Like a PEASANT who took the “Spark” Perk, which this is incompatible with) you have an extremely powerful one. You don’t limit your scientific explorations to a single topic, but are a master of anything that meets your eye (well, at least once you’re in the Madness Place). You go further and farther than almost anyone, and when you get working, you quickly stop caring about things like “fundamental laws” and “nature of the universe” and ... well, pretty much anything. Warping the fabric of reality is a pretty common thing. Unfortunately, it’s also significantly harder to get OUT of the Madness Place, and you get sidetracked pretty easily as well. Last week you were trying to get a stain out of your carpet, and woke up with an army of death-ray-wielding mice obedient to your commands! MWAHAHAHA.
* I have zero knowledge of girl genius or if having a spark comes with a time aspect to it.
* Sparks can build reality warping machines within hours thanks to their spark nature, rayguns that destroy mountains or dozens of robots would be built while you sleep. With real effort entire castle size creations would take days at the most. Very much a time boost. 


-We Need Reserves | Special Attention (Gundam AGE) (800CP)
We Need Reserves (400CP) When you’re fighting a war, you know what you need-you need troops, you need squadrons; you need a fully-armed army. You can’t fight a war without numbers, and so you can modify designs to give you just that-numbers. Your MS production capability will multiply to near 4x levels, with only a negligible decrease in quality. You can also, with time and patience, apply this design philosophy to other products. 
Special Attention (400CP) When you’re fighting a war, you know what you need-you need guardians, you need shields; you need a well-armed force. You can’t fight a war with a thousand scratches, and so you can modify designs to increase individual performance and quality-the biggest boon is that this only negligibly increases production times or costs, at the benefit of having much higher quality Mobile Suits. And you can apply this to other designs as well, with time.


-Thirty Thousand Seeds (Desolate Era II) (800CP)
It’s tedious to continually check in on all of your projects, especially when they’re on the other side of the known Chaosverse. Scientific endeavors need maintenance and tweaking, raising a student might not lead to them being useful in any way. Thus it’s probably a good thing that side projects like that always advance as if you put 100% of all your effort into them, and always come back to benefit you in some way, no matter how miniscule. Leaving a kid you found with some techniques might let him skyrocket in strength to one day come help you in a war. Creating a race of ultimate warriors might see them naturally evolve to fulfill that directive, maybe even evolving traits that make them stand above the rest. Casting aside a single Godgem to create a Chaosworld may lead to the creation of the greatest genius in the history of the Chaosverse. Though that one’s still pretty unlikely. Even if these side projects don’t help you much, they’ll never be a detriment. Go ahead and seed the entire Chaosverse with your power.


-The Man who understood Infinity (Desolate Era II) (800CP)
One such as you who has a shocking and unseen talent can feel forced into a single path, the one you are best at. But you did not become the greatest in the Three Realms simply for the sake of being another specialist. No, you're a Genius, with a capital G. Whatever you find your most interesting specialization, you can uplift other side projects to train just as fast. There is one caveat however, that being that this can only be applied to five specialties at a time, though you can switch between them with little to no fanfare. If you’re a master of the sword but have a deep admiration for Spacetime, there’s no need to worry about talent anymore, you’ll have enough to get to speed.
* Allows the effects of extremely powerful specialist perks to apply to other fields.
